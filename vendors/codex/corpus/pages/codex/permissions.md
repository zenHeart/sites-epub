Beta. Permission profiles are under active development and may change.

Permission profiles do not compose with the older sandbox settings. Configure
  either `default_permissions` and `[permissions]`, or `sandbox_mode` /
  `sandbox_workspace_write`, but not both. If `sandbox_mode` appears in any
  loaded config file, you pass `--sandbox`, or the selected config profile sets
  `sandbox_mode`, Codex uses those older sandbox settings instead of
  `default_permissions`.

Managed `allowed_permission_profiles` is the exception: it makes Codex use
permission profiles. Remove older settings such as
`sandbox_mode` and `[sandbox_workspace_write]` before deploying a managed
profile allowlist. For a mixed-version enterprise rollout, you can keep the
managed `allowed_sandbox_modes` requirement as a temporary compatibility
constraint until every client runs Codex 0.138.0 or later.

Permission profiles let you apply least-privilege boundaries to local commands
Codex runs on your behalf. A profile is a named policy that combines filesystem
rules, which define what commands can read or write, with network rules, which
define which destinations commands can reach.

A profile's `network.enabled = true` permits command network access, but it
  does not start the network proxy. To enforce profile domain rules, also set
  `features.network_proxy = true` in `config.toml`, or use enabled,
  administrator-managed `[experimental_network]` requirements. Without an active
  proxy, profile domain rules do not restrict direct network access.

Use profiles to give Codex enough access for the current chat without granting
broad access to your machine or network. For example, a read-only profile can
let Codex inspect a project without editing it, while a write-capable profile
can limit edits to selected workspace roots.

Local permission profiles are supported on macOS, Linux, WSL, and native
Windows. See [Scope and enforcement](#scope-and-enforcement) for platform-specific
details and caveats.

For Codex cloud network settings, see [Internet Access](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/cloud/internet-access).

## Define and select a profile

Codex includes three built-in permission profiles:

- `:read-only` keeps local command execution read-only.
- `:workspace` allows writes inside the active workspace roots and system temp directories.
- `:danger-full-access` removes local sandbox restrictions and should be used
  only when that broad access is intentional.

Create a named profile under `[permissions.<name>]`, then set the top-level
`default_permissions` key to that profile name or to one of the built-ins above.
In this example, `project-edit` is a user-defined profile name, not a built-in
value.

Enterprise administrators can define profiles and restrict which profiles
users may select through managed `requirements.toml`. Once
`allowed_permission_profiles` is present, omitted profiles are denied,
including omitted built-ins and profiles added in future Codex versions. See
[Control available permission profiles](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/managed-configuration#control-available-permission-profiles)
for the recommended managed configuration.

Custom profiles use two related concepts:

- `[permissions.<name>.workspace_roots]` adds concrete directories that should
  count as workspace roots for that profile.
- `[permissions.<name>.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]` defines the filesystem
  rules Codex applies inside every effective workspace root: the current
  session's runtime workspace roots plus the profile-defined roots above.

Profiles also use the normal config-layer model. Higher-precedence layers can
add or replace entries under the same profile name without restating the whole
profile.

For example, an organization-level config and a user-level config can extend
the same profile independently:

```toml
# /etc/codex/config.toml
[permissions.server.workspace_roots]
"~/code/server" = true
```

```toml
# ~/.codex/config.toml
[permissions.server.workspace_roots]
"~/code/mobile-app" = true
```

When `server` is active, both workspace roots participate in the effective
profile.

```toml
default_permissions = "project-edit"

[features]
network_proxy = true

[permissions.project-edit.workspace_roots]
"~/code/app" = true
"~/code/shared-lib" = true

[permissions.project-edit.filesystem]
":minimal" = "read"

[permissions.project-edit.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"." = "write"
".devcontainer" = "read"
"**/*.env" = "deny"

[permissions.project-edit.network]
enabled = true

[permissions.project-edit.network.domains]
"api.openai.com" = "allow"
"objects.githubusercontent.com" = "allow"
"*.github.com" = "allow"
"tracking.example.com" = "deny"
```

This profile:

- Reads the minimal runtime paths common developer tools need.
- Applies the same workspace-root rules to the current session and the
  profile-defined roots.
- Keeps IDE-adjacent settings such as `.devcontainer/` read-only under each
  root.
- Denies matching environment files with a glob rule.
- Allows network access only through the configured domain policy.

Inside an active profile, narrower deny rules stay in force even when a broader
path is readable or writable. For example, a profile can make workspace roots
writable while still setting a matching `.env` path to `deny`.

## Extend a profile

Use `extends` when a profile is mostly the same as a built-in or another named
profile. Prefer extending a built-in profile over starting from scratch so
baseline protections carry forward. Extending `:workspace`, for example, keeps
the workspace root's `.codex` directory read-only unless you explicitly
override it. Set the parent once, then add or override only the rules that
differ.

```toml
default_permissions = "project-edit"

[features]
network_proxy = true

[permissions.project-edit]
description = "Project editing with OpenAI API access."
extends = ":workspace"

[permissions.project-edit.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"**/*.env" = "deny"

[permissions.project-edit.network]
enabled = true

[permissions.project-edit.network.domains]
"api.openai.com" = "allow"
```

This profile starts with `:workspace`, keeps matching `.env` files denied, and
allows requests to `api.openai.com`. A profile can extend `:read-only`,
`:workspace`, or another named profile. It cannot extend
`:danger-full-access`; Codex also rejects unknown parents and inheritance
cycles.

| `permissions.<name>.network.dangerously_allow_all_unix_sockets`   | Boolean                    | `false`                 | Bypasses the Unix socket allowlist where Unix socket proxying is supported. This is a broad local escape hatch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Filesystem permissions

Filesystem entries use `read`, `write`, or `deny`:

| Access  | Meaning                                                                                                                           |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `read`  | Allows commands to read files and list directories under the path. Commands cannot create, modify, rename, or delete files there. |
| `write` | Allows commands to read and modify files under the path, including creating, renaming, and deleting files when the OS allows it.  |
| `deny`  | Denies both reads and writes under the path. Use it to carve out a denied subpath from a broader `read` or `write` grant.         |

More specific entries override broader entries. When two entries target the
same path, `deny` takes precedence over `write`, and `write` takes precedence
over `read`.

This precedence lets a profile describe a broad working area first, then carve
out files or directories that should stay unreadable:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.filesystem]
":minimal" = "read"

[permissions.project-edit.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"." = "write"
".devcontainer" = "read"
"**/*.env" = "deny"
```

In this example, the workspace root stays writable, `.devcontainer/` stays
readable without becoming writable, and matching environment files remain
unavailable to sandboxed commands.

A more specific path can also reopen a narrower subtree inside a broader deny:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.filesystem]
"~/Documents" = "deny"
"~/Documents/codex" = "write"
```

Supported path forms:

| Path               | Meaning                                                                                     | Scoped subpaths |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `:root`            | The filesystem root                                                                         | `.` only        |
| `:minimal`         | Platform and runtime paths needed by common tools                                           | `.` only        |
| `:workspace_roots` | The current session's workspace roots plus any enabled profile-defined workspace roots      | Yes             |
| `:tmpdir`          | The `$TMPDIR` location, when one is available                                               | `.` only        |
| `:slash_tmp`       | The `/tmp` folder, if it exists                                                             | `.` only        |
| `/absolute/path`   | A platform absolute path, such as `/path` on macOS/Linux/WSL or `C:\path` on native Windows | Yes             |
| `~/path`           | A path under the current user's home directory                                              | Yes             |

On native Windows, home-relative paths can also use backslashes, such as
`~\work`.

Use `:root` only when a profile intentionally needs broad read coverage:

```toml
[permissions.audit.filesystem]
":root" = "read"
```

Use nested entries under `:workspace_roots` to scope access to workspace-root
relative subpaths:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"." = "write"          # each workspace root
"docs" = "read"        # each workspace-root docs directory
"generated" = "deny"   # each workspace-root generated directory
```

Nested subpaths must stay inside their workspace root. Parent traversal such as
`../other-repo` is rejected.

### Deny reads with exact paths or globs

Use `deny` for files or subtrees that Codex should not read, even when a broader
profile rule grants access nearby. Exact paths work well for stable locations
such as `~/.ssh`. Glob patterns work better when a profile needs to cover a
family of sensitive files whose exact locations vary across repositories.

When a glob sits under `:workspace_roots`, Codex interprets it relative to each
effective workspace root. For example:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"**/*.env" = "deny"
```

This rule denies reads for matching `.env` files found beneath each runtime or
profile-defined workspace root. Use it when you want to preserve normal
workspace writes while keeping environment files, generated secrets, or similar
credential-bearing files unreadable.

`deny` glob patterns are supported as deny-read rules. `read` or `write` globs
are less portable on Linux, WSL, and native Windows sandboxing, so prefer exact
paths or subtree rules such as `"docs/**" = "read"` when possible.

On Linux, WSL, and native Windows, an unbounded `**` deny-read pattern may need
bounded pre-expansion before the sandbox starts. Set `glob_scan_max_depth` when
you use an unbounded pattern such as `"**/*.env" = "deny"`:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.filesystem]
glob_scan_max_depth = 3

[permissions.project-edit.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"**/*.env" = "deny"
```

`glob_scan_max_depth` must be at least `1`. Higher values scan deeper before
sandbox startup, which can add startup work on Linux, WSL, and native Windows.
If you prefer not to use bounded expansion, enumerate explicit depths such as
`*.env`, `*/*.env`, and `*/*/*.env`.

Add reusable workspace roots to the profile when the same rules should apply to
more than the current session root:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.workspace_roots]
"~/code/app" = true
"~/code/shared-lib" = true
```

When this profile is active, Codex applies the `:workspace_roots` rules to the
current session's runtime workspace roots and to each enabled profile-defined
workspace root.

On native Windows, drive-letter paths such as `D:\work` and UNC paths such as
`\\server\share` are supported as absolute paths.

## Network permissions

Network access and network filtering are separate settings. Set
`permissions.<name>.network.enabled = true` to let commands access the network,
and enable `features.network_proxy` to enforce the profile's domain rules:

```toml
[features]
network_proxy = true

[permissions.project-edit.network]
enabled = true

[permissions.project-edit.network.domains]
"example.com" = "allow"      # exact host
"*.example.com" = "allow"    # subdomains only
"**.example.com" = "allow"   # apex and subdomains
"ads.example.com" = "deny"   # deny wins over allow
```

The resulting behavior depends on both settings:

- Network off: Commands cannot access the network, regardless of the proxy
  feature.
- Network on, proxy off: Commands have direct, unrestricted network
  access. Domain rules in the permission profile are not enforced.
- Network on, proxy on: Commands use the proxy, which enforces the profile's
  domain rules. If the active proxy has no allowed domains, it blocks external
  destinations.

Adding `[permissions.<name>.network.domains]` or setting
`permissions.<name>.network.enabled = true` does not enable
`features.network_proxy`. As an alternative, administrators can enable the
proxy with `[experimental_network]` in `requirements.toml`. See
[Managed configuration](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/managed-configuration#configure-network-access-requirements).

When active, the network sandbox proxy binds to local listeners by default:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.network]
enabled = true
proxy_url = "http://127.0.0.1:3128"
enable_socks5 = true
socks_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8081"
enable_socks5_udp = true
```

Leave these listener settings at their defaults unless you are integrating with
a specific runtime. The `dangerously_*` network keys are escape hatches for
specialized environments and should not be used for ordinary local development.

### Local and private networks

When the network proxy is active, Codex applies a local/private-network guard by
default as a defense against DNS rebinding and accidental access to local
services. To intentionally allow a literal local target, allowlist the exact
host or IP literal:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.network.domains]
"localhost" = "allow"
"127.0.0.1" = "allow"
```

Set `allow_local_binding = true` only when the profile must reach allowlisted
hostnames that resolve to local or private addresses:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.network]
enabled = true
allow_local_binding = true

[permissions.project-edit.network.domains]
"localhost" = "allow"
```

### Unix sockets

Unix socket proxying is a local escape hatch for tools such as Docker. Use it
sparingly:

```toml
[permissions.project-edit.network.unix_sockets]
"/var/run/docker.sock" = "allow"
"/tmp/old.sock" = "deny"
```

Use `deny` to reject a socket path, including an inherited allow entry. Denied
socket paths are omitted from the effective allowlist.

When Unix sockets are enabled, keep proxy listeners bound to loopback addresses.

## Migrate from older sandbox settings

Permission profiles replace the older combination of `sandbox_mode` and
`sandbox_workspace_write` when you want one reusable profile to describe both
filesystem and network behavior. Use one system or the other for a session, not
both.

Suggested starting points:

- For a read-only workflow, use the built-in `:read-only` profile or define a
  custom profile with read access only where needed.
- For workspace editing, use the built-in `:workspace` profile or define a
  custom profile that writes through `:workspace_roots` and adds only the extra
  temp or cache paths the workflow needs.
- For unrestricted local execution, use `:danger-full-access` only when you
  intentionally want the broadest local access model.

Profiles describe the local default posture for a session. Organization-managed
requirements can still add restrictions that user configuration should not
broaden. See [Managed configuration](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/managed-configuration)
for admin-enforced filesystem and network constraints.

## Scope and enforcement

Permission profiles define the boundaries for local sandboxed command
execution. Use them together with approval policies and the separate controls
for web search, connectors, MCP servers, the built-in browser, Computer Use,
and Codex cloud.

### What profiles control

- **Local command execution:** Permission profiles govern sandboxed commands
  that run on your machine. Connectors, MCP servers, browser or
  computer-use surfaces, Codex cloud environment settings, and approved
  escalations use their own controls.
- **Filesystem writes:** A write-capable profile can create persistent changes.
  Treat writes to scripts, build steps, package manager hooks, shell startup
  files, and shared directories as sensitive because later tools or users can
  execute those files outside the original sandbox context.
- **Outbound destinations:** Network domain rules constrain where sandboxed
  command traffic can go only while the network proxy is active. They do not
  determine whether an allowed destination is trustworthy, and wildcard allow
  rules stay broad.
- **Local services:** An active network proxy blocks local and private network
  targets by default. Allowlisting `localhost`, private IPs, Unix sockets, or setting
  `allow_local_binding = true` explicitly opens access to local services.

### What the network proxy does not control

The network proxy only filters traffic from local commands that run inside the
sandbox. It does not apply the profile's domain allowlist to:

- **Web search:** The hosted search tool uses its own access settings. Use
  `web_search` and, for managed clients, `allowed_web_search_modes` to control
  it. `tools.web_search.allowed_domains` filters search results, not command
  network access.
- **Apps and connectors:** Connector-backed tools use their own service-side
  connections, workspace permissions, and app or tool settings.
- **MCP servers:** Local and remote MCP servers use their own process or
  transport. Control them with `mcp_servers` configuration and managed server
  allowlists.
- **Browser and Computer Use:** Browser navigation and computer-use actions
  use their own feature and approval controls.
- **Codex service traffic:** Model, authentication, and other client service
  requests use the client's separate HTTP and system-proxy settings.
- **Codex cloud:** These tasks use their environment's own
  [internet access settings](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/cloud/internet-access).

To limit these surfaces, configure each capability directly. A command network
allowlist is not a global network policy for every action Codex can perform.

### How enforcement works

- On macOS, Codex uses Seatbelt sandbox profiles. If the selected policy cannot
  be enforced by the platform sandbox, Codex refuses to run the command instead
  of silently running it unsandboxed.
- On Linux and WSL, Codex uses [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap)
  and [seccomp](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/seccomp_filter.html),
  with Landlock available for compatibility fallback paths. The strongest
  enforcement path depends on user namespaces and kernel support; restricted
  container hosts can force compatibility paths, and unsupported split policies
  are refused.
- On native Windows, [`elevated` sandboxing](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/windows/windows-sandbox#windows-sandbox)
  is strongest because it can use dedicated lower-privilege sandbox users,
  filesystem permission boundaries, and firewall rules. `unelevated`
  sandboxing is a fallback with weaker network isolation and cannot enforce
  every split read/write carveout, so unsupported policies are refused. Use WSL
  when you need the Linux sandbox model.

### Operational guidance

Choose the narrowest profile that still lets the task complete, especially when
you grant writes or outbound network access. Keep approval policy, secret
handling, and allow rules aligned with that access level.

## Common profiles

### Read-only with network allowlist

```toml
default_permissions = "readonly-net"

[features]
network_proxy = true

[permissions.readonly-net.filesystem]
":minimal" = "read"

[permissions.readonly-net.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"." = "read"

[permissions.readonly-net.network]
enabled = true

[permissions.readonly-net.network.domains]
"api.openai.com" = "allow"
```

### File access limited to workspace

Here is an example of a permission profile that will make your workspace folders writable by Codex while denying reads to the rest of the filesystem (with limited exceptions, as determined by `:minimal`).

```toml
default_permissions = "workspace-only"

[permissions.workspace-only]
# By extending the :workspace profile, you get Codex's safeguards to ensure
# subfolders such as .codex/ and .git/ within a workspace root are read-only
# while the rest of the folder is writable.
extends = ":workspace"

[permissions.workspace-only.filesystem]
# By default, deny read access to all files on disk.
":root" = "deny"

# Though in practice, a software agent needs to be able to read folders that
# contain common tools, such as `/usr/bin`, to get work done, so grant access
# to a "minimal" set of files and folders, as determined by Codex.
":minimal" = "read"

# By extending the :workspace profile, :tmpdir and :slash_tmp are "write" by
# default, though you can deny access to them altogether, if desired.
":tmpdir" = "deny"
":slash_tmp" = "deny"
```

### Workspace write without network

```toml
default_permissions = "project-edit"

[permissions.project-edit.filesystem]
":minimal" = "read"

[permissions.project-edit.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"." = "write"

[permissions.project-edit.network]

### Workspace write with public web access

```toml
default_permissions = "workspace-net"

[features]
network_proxy = true

[permissions.workspace-net.filesystem]
":minimal" = "read"

[permissions.workspace-net.filesystem.":workspace_roots"]
"." = "write"

[permissions.workspace-net.network]
enabled = true

[permissions.workspace-net.network.domains]
"*" = "allow"
```

Use the global `"*"` allow rule only when you intend to allow public network
access. Deny rules can narrow a broad allowlist.
