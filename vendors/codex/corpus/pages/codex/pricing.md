## Invite friends and coworkers

Eligible users can send Codex invitations from the profile menu in the
lower-left corner of the app. Choose **Invite a friend** on an eligible personal
plan or **Invite a coworker** in an eligible Business workspace, enter the
recipient's email address, and send the invitation.

The invitation dialog shows the current reward, recipient requirements, invite
limits, and when rewards expire for your plan or promotion. Personal and
Business referral programs have separate rewards and eligibility rules.
Referrals aren't currently available for ChatGPT Enterprise.

From June 11 through June 24, 2026, eligible Plus and Pro users can invite up to
three friends. When an eligible recipient sends their first Codex message, both
people receive a banked rate-limit reset. Banked rate-limit resets are usable for
30 days after they're granted. Business referrals use separate shared-workspace
credit rewards; review the
[current terms](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001271) before you send an
invitation.

## Frequently asked questions

### How much does Sites cost?

[Sites](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/sites) is included with eligible ChatGPT plans during public
beta. Availability depends on your plan, region, and workspace settings.

### What are the usage limits for my plan?

The number of messages you can send depends on the model used, size and
complexity of your tasks, and whether you run them locally or in the cloud.
Small scripts or routine functions may consume only a fraction of your
allowance, while larger projects, long-running tasks, or extended sessions that
require the agent to hold more context will use significantly more per message.

Tasks that look similar can consume different amounts of your allowance. Model
choice, context, reasoning, tool use, retrieval, and caching all affect usage,
so prompt length alone isn't a reliable estimate.

Choose the GPT-5.6 model that best fits your work:

- **Sol** is built for the hardest work—complex reasoning, ambiguous problems,
  advanced coding, and high-stakes decisions.
- **Terra** is the everyday workhorse for production tasks, reporting, document
  analysis, coding, and work that requires sound judgment.
- **Luna** is optimized for fast, high-volume work such as routing,
  classification, extraction, support, background automation, and focused coding
  tasks.




The estimates below show local messages per five-hour window. Cloud chats on
ChatGPT plans use GPT-5.6 Sol and may use more of your allowance than local
messages.

</TableWrapper>

Usage limits are shared with other agentic features once pricing for those
features is effective. This currently includes [ChatGPT for
Excel](https://help.openai.com/articles/20001063) on Plus and Pro.

Speed configurations increase credit consumption for all applicable models, so
they also use included limits faster. Fast mode consumes credits at a higher
rate for supported models. See [Speed](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/speed) for supported models and
rates. Image generations also use included limits ~3-5x faster on average,
depending on image quality and size. GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark is in research preview
for ChatGPT Pro users only, and isn't available in the API at launch. Because it
runs on specialized low-latency hardware, usage is governed by a separate usage
limit that may adjust based on demand.

### ChatGPT Voice in Desktop

ChatGPT Voice on desktop uses a separate, plan-dependent allowance measured in
rolling five-hour windows. Tasks started through Voice use your existing Codex
usage budget. ChatGPT notifies you when you reach either limit.

ChatGPT Voice in Desktop uses a duplex model: GPT-Live manages the live
conversation, while GPT-5.6 Terra starts and coordinates tasks in the app.

- **Plus:** Approximately 15–30 minutes
- **Pro 5x ($100/month):** Approximately 1–2.5 hours
- **Pro 20x ($200/month):** Unlimited voice access
- **Business:** Approximately 45 minutes
- **Enterprise / Edu (legacy):** Approximately 45 minutes

Unlimited voice access doesn't make Codex tasks unlimited. Tasks started through
ChatGPT Voice continue to use your existing Codex usage budget.

For Business, Edu, and Enterprise workspaces with credit-based or pay-as-you-go
billing, Desktop voice costs approximately 6 credits per minute. ChatGPT Voice
in Desktop is not available via API Key currently.

### What happens when you hit usage limits?

We want you to be able to complete work already in progress. If you reach your
usage limits during an active turn, the agent will be able to continue working
on that turn, subject to fair use limits.

ChatGPT Plus and Pro users who reach their usage limit can purchase additional
credits to continue working without needing to upgrade their existing plan.

Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans with [flexible
pricing](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487671-flexible-pricing-for-the-enterprise-edu-and-business-plans)
can purchase additional workspace credits to continue working.

If you are approaching usage limits, you can also switch to a smaller model to
make your usage limits last longer.

All users may also run extra local chats using an API key, with usage charged at
[standard API rates](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing).

<a id="image-generation-usage-limits"></a>

### How does image generation count toward usage limits?

Image generation counts toward the same general usage limits as local
messages and cloud chats. Image generations use included limits 3-5x faster on
average than similar turns without image generation, depending on
image quality and size. After you reach your included limits, image generation
also draws from [credits](#credits-overview).

Image generation isn't available on the Free plan. When you use Codex with an
API key, API pricing applies to image generation instead of included ChatGPT
usage limits.

### Where can I see my current usage limits?

You can find your current limits in the [usage
dashboard](https://chatgpt.com/codex/settings/usage). If you want to see your
remaining limits during an active Codex CLI session, you can use `/status`.

Check the dashboard every week or two to understand your pace and remaining
capacity. If usage is higher than expected, consider whether a smaller model or
tighter task scope would still produce a useful result.

### What are tokens and credits?

Tokens are small units of information that ChatGPT reads and writes. Your
prompt, files, chat history, tool results, and ChatGPT's response all
use tokens.

Credits translate token usage into a simpler unit for tracking and managing
consumption. The credit cost varies by model, context, reasoning, and tools.
After you reach your included limits, available credits let you continue
working.

Usage is calculated in credits per million input tokens, cached input tokens,
and output tokens. [Learn more about
tokens](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them).

The rate card below shows the credit cost per million tokens for models and
features.

A small subset of Enterprise customers should continue using the legacy rate
card until we migrate you to the new token-based pricing. For more information,

sales](https://chatgpt.com/contact-sales?utm_internal_source=openai_developers_codex).

### What counts as Code Review usage?

Code Review usage applies only when Codex runs reviews through GitHub—for
example, when you tag `@Codex` for review in a pull request or enable automatic
reviews on your repository. Reviews run locally or outside of GitHub count
toward your general usage limits.

### What can I do to make my usage limits last longer?

The usage limits and credits above are average rates. You can try the following
tips to maximize your limits:

- **Control the size of your prompts.** Be precise with the instructions you
  give the agent, but remove unnecessary context.
- **Limit source material.** Provide only relevant files and, when possible,
  narrow the sources or date range.
- **Match the output to the need.** Define the audience, format, and length, and
  separate required work from optional improvements.
- **Reduce the size of your AGENTS.md.** If you work on a larger project, you
  can control how much context you inject through AGENTS.md files by [nesting
  them within your repository](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/agents-md#layer-project-instructions).
- **Limit the number of MCP servers you use.** Every
  [MCP](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/extend/mcp) server adds more context to your messages and uses
  more of your limit. Disable MCP servers when you don’t need them.
