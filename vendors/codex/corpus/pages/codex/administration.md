  description="Set access and policy boundaries for ChatGPT, Codex developer tools, APIs, plugins, and connected systems."
  intro="Administration covers six related boundaries: ChatGPT workspace access; local runtime policy for covered capabilities in the ChatGPT desktop app, Codex CLI, and IDE extension; Codex cloud eligibility; Platform API access; plugin availability and connector permissions; and permissions in connected systems. Start with workspace identity and access, then apply the runtime and source-system controls required for each deployment."
