# Import from another agent

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](https://learn.chatgpt.com/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

Use the import flow to bring instructions, settings, skills, plugins, projects,
and recent work from another agent into the ChatGPT desktop app or Codex CLI.
The desktop app can import from **Claude Code**, **Claude Cowork**,
or **Cursor**. Codex CLI can import from **Claude Code** or **Cursor**.

The desktop app imports supported items directly and lets you finish setup for
imported plugins or connections that need authorization. You can also keep
imported work in sync with automatic updates.

Importing doesn't change or delete your existing agent setup.

## Start an import

### Import in the desktop app

<WorkflowSteps>

1. In the ChatGPT desktop app, open **Settings > Import**. If **Import** isn't
   available as a settings section yet, open **General** and find **Import other
   agent setup**.
2. Select **Import**.
3. Choose the agents you want to import from, then select **Continue**.
4. On **Select items to import**, choose what to bring over, then select **Continue**.
5. After the import finishes, open an imported project or chat to continue working.

</WorkflowSteps>

### Keep imported work in sync

In the ChatGPT desktop app, open **Settings > Import** and turn on automatic
updates to keep imported work in sync with the original agent. You can also
review your import history from the same settings section.

### Import in Codex CLI

1. Start a local Codex CLI session and type `/import`.
2. Choose **Claude Code** or **Cursor**.
3. Select the supported setup, project files, and recent chats you want to
   import.
4. Review the imported configuration and continue working in Codex.

Codex CLI imports up to 50 chats from the last 30 days. The `/import` command
isn't available during a running task, in a remote session, or while connected
to a local app-server daemon. See [CLI slash
commands](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/developer-commands?surface=cli#cli-import-claude-code-or-cursor-setup-with-import).

## How importing works

The import flow checks both your user-level setup and your existing projects.
User-level setup comes from files on your machine. Project-level setup comes
from files in the repositories and folders you select.

When you import, ChatGPT:

1. Detects supported setup and recent work.
2. Imports the items you select.
3. Leaves your existing agent setup unchanged.
4. Checks whether imported plugins or connections still need setup.
5. Shows a status card when you need to finish setup.

## Finish setup after importing

When the import completes, the app shows a status card in the lower-left corner.
If an imported plugin or connection still needs setup, the card calls it out.

When the app flags an item that needs attention, select **Finish** and follow the
prompts to complete setup.

## What to review after importing

Review imported setup before you rely on it, especially:

- Tool restrictions or permissions in imported skills and agents.
- MCP server settings that use custom authentication, headers, environment
  variables, or transports. You may need to sign in again.
- Hooks whose behavior may differ after import.
- Plugins, marketplaces, or other setup that needs manual follow-up.
- Prompt templates or command-style prompts that depend on arguments, shell
  interpolation, or file-path placeholders.

## After you import

Once the import finishes, open one of your imported projects and continue from
there. See [Use ChatGPT](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/use-chatgpt) for guidance on starting your
next task.
