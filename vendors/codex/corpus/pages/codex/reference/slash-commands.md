# Slash commands

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](https://learn.chatgpt.com/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

Slash commands let you run actions without leaving the chat composer. Available
commands vary based on your environment and access.

## Use a slash command

1. In the chat composer, type `/`.
2. Select a command from the list, or keep typing to filter (for example, `/status`).

You can also explicitly invoke skills by typing `$` in the chat composer. See
[Skills & Plugins](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/skills-and-plugins).

Enabled skills also appear in the slash command list. Custom prompts appear as
`/prompts:<name>` commands.

## Set or manage a goal with `/goal`

Use `/goal` in the app composer to start Goal mode. A goal is a persistent
objective that ChatGPT works toward until it finishes the task, pauses, or needs
more input. To define the goal with ChatGPT first, start with `/plan`, then set
the refined goal with `/goal`.


  

> Illustration: ChatGPT desktop app goal progress controls above the composer




When a goal is active, the app shows its progress above the composer. Use the
buttons in that progress row to pause or resume the goal, edit the goal text, or
clear the goal instead of typing another slash command. You can keep steering
ChatGPT with follow-up messages while the goal runs.

For guidance on writing effective goals, see [Goal mode](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/prompting#goal-mode).
