OpenAI develops key parts of Codex in the open. That work lives on GitHub so you can follow progress, report issues, and contribute improvements.

If you maintain a widely used open-source project or want to nominate maintainers stewarding important projects, you can also [apply to the Codex for OSS program](https://developers.openai.com/community/codex-for-oss) for API credits, ChatGPT Pro with Codex, and selective access to Codex Security.
