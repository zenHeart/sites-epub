  description="Control what ChatGPT and Codex developer tools can access, understand how work is isolated, and apply safeguards for security-sensitive tasks."
  intro="Security controls define what ChatGPT and Codex developer tools can access and how sensitive actions are reviewed. Permissions, sandboxing, approvals, and network access establish trust boundaries. Codex Security helps find and remediate vulnerabilities, and cyber safety guidance explains how security-sensitive work is handled."
