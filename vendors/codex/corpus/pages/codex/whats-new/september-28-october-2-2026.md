[Back to What's new](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/whats-new#september-28october-2-2026)

## Choose GPT-6.1 Sol for complex work

[GPT-6.1 Sol](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/models#gpt-61-sol) offers near-Astra performance at a
lower cost than Astra. Consider it for repeated, long-running work across code,
apps, and documents. Availability depends on your plan, client, and workspace
settings. See the [launch announcement](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/changelog#codex-2026-09-29-gpt-61-sol)
and [pricing](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/pricing) for details.

## Delegate ongoing work to your dot

[Dots](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/dots) are always-on agents that take on ongoing responsibility
in ChatGPT. Give your dot a goal, such as preparing meeting briefs or
tracking project updates, and define what it can do on its own. It keeps
making progress between conversations, using connected apps, creating
files, and delegating tasks to ChatGPT Work or Codex.

Start with one dot, give it a name, and make it your own. Your dot has its
own cloud computer and browser. It brings back results for your review
and reaches out through supported contact methods when a decision needs
your judgment. You can review its work or give it a new direction anytime.
Dots are rolling out gradually. See [availability](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/dots#access) for eligible plans, regions, and setup requirements.

## Use GPT-6 Astra Ultrafast

[Ultrafast mode](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-configuration/speed#ultrafast-mode) is available
in Codex and ChatGPT Work on the Pro \$500/month plan and eligible Enterprise and Edu
plans. On Pro, it draws from included usage or available credits. Enterprise
usage follows the workspace's credit-based or USD usage-based agreement.

Enterprise access is off by default; workspace owners can enable it for
selected users or the workspace. Ultrafast isn't available to workspaces
that require inference residency outside the United States.

## Prepare reusable Codex Cloud environments

Describe your development setup and let Codex install dependencies, prepare
tools, and test the workflow. [Publish the environment](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/environments/cloud-environments)
to reuse its prepared filesystem. Each new task gets its own isolated
workspace. Access depends on your plan and workspace settings.

## Scan repositories with Codex Security Cloud

[Codex Security Cloud](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/security/setup) is available in research preview
on the web and in the desktop app. In a workspace with access, install the
plugin to scan connected GitHub repositories or monitor new commits. Review
findings, validation evidence, and available patches before creating a draft
pull request.

## Continue Work across devices

When your workspace enables Local computer access with Work Cloud, start a new ChatGPT Work task on desktop
and continue the conversation from web or mobile. Tasks can use approved
files and tools on a connected computer; keep that computer online for steps
that need it. Existing tasks keep their original mode.

See [Work across devices](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/get-started-with-work#continue-work-across-devices)
and the [administrator setup guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/cloud-local-access).

## Work together in ChatGPT Space

Where available, [ChatGPT Space](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/space) brings Pages and saved files
together. Ask ChatGPT to draft or revise a Page, edit it directly, and share
it with collaborators. Use `@ChatGPT` or `@dot` to ask for help in a Page,
or use slash commands to generate text, images, and visualizations.
Review the available permissions before sharing.

Start with the [Space getting-started guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/space/getting-started)
or learn how to [work on Pages together](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/space/collaboration).

## Set up shared team workflows

- **ChatGPT in Slack and Microsoft Teams:** Request work in approved
  conversations using your deployment's connected tools. Workspace admins
  can [configure deployments and access](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/chatgpt-slack-and-teams).
- **Team Tasks:** Run [scheduled or event-triggered work](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/teams), such as
  project digests, through a team's service account and approved connections.
- **Workspace connections:** Admins can [connect company-managed accounts](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/shared-connections)
  for eligible teams and workflows. Each connection uses the connected
  account's permissions.

Availability and supported controls depend on your workspace and rollout.

## Sign in to apps with ChatGPT

[Sign in with ChatGPT](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/quickstart) lets users sign in to your app and,
where eligible, use their ChatGPT plan for AI requests. Eligible Plus and Pro
users can bring their plan usage to participating apps.

Commercial sign-in is in a limited trial with selected partners. ChatGPT plan
usage is available to open-source partners and selected private clients.
Start with the [open-source integration](https://developers.openai.com/siwc/token-sharing-open-source).

## Extend your plugin's interface

[Plugin Extensions](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/extensions) let developers add sidebar
apps, conversation panels, file viewers and editors, and forms to ChatGPT.
Composer mentions are available only in the desktop app. Free and Go web extensions are coming soon.

## Respond to MCP events

[MCP Events](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/mcp-events) lets users ask ChatGPT to monitor
updates from your server and act when matching events arrive. For example,
a user can ask ChatGPT to summarize new messages or respond to document feedback.

This integration requires MCP 2.0. ChatGPT supports webhook delivery from
the draft MCP Events specification; polling and streaming aren't supported.

## Customize website annotations

Use [Annotations Extensibility](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/annotations-extensibility) to choose
what people can select on your website, attach relevant context, and provide
controls for previewing changes before sending feedback to ChatGPT. The
Browser Annotation API is available in supported versions of the desktop
app's built-in browser.
