ChatGPT Work is part of your existing ChatGPT workspace and follows its
applicable privacy, security, and data-handling policies. For Business,
Enterprise, and Edu workspaces, existing protections include encryption in
transit and at rest, and OpenAI doesn't use business data to train its models by
default.

Work Cloud also introduces hosted task execution and optional tools that can
access connected systems or take authorized actions. Review the permissions,
retention settings, and available audit records for the capabilities your
organization enables.

Capabilities and controls depend on the workspace plan, rollout, configuration,
and connected integration. For the broader execution model, see the
[ChatGPT Work Overview](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/chatgpt-work-overview).

## Security at a glance

- Tasks in the cloud run on OpenAI-managed infrastructure, not on the user's
  device.
- A cloud task doesn't inherit local files, desktop applications, browser
  sessions, or private-network access from that device.
- Connected apps use the permissions of the authorized account, which can be an
  individual, shared, or agent-owned account.
- Workspace and feature-specific controls govern Work access, local
  execution, cloud browsing, connected apps, and code or shell networking.
- Business, Enterprise, and Edu workspace data is encrypted in transit and at
  rest and isn't used to train OpenAI models by default.
- Retention and audit visibility depend on the data category, storage location,
  event, and applicable product configuration.

## Where cloud tasks run

People can start cloud tasks from supported ChatGPT web, mobile, or desktop
experiences. Work on the web and mobile runs in the cloud. The desktop app can
run cloud or local tasks when the corresponding permissions are available and
enabled.

The user's device sits within the organization's own IT-managed trust
boundary, outside OpenAI-operated systems. Starting a cloud task from the
desktop app doesn't give the task direct access to the user's computer.
Execution stays in the OpenAI-managed environment regardless of the surface
used to start it.

Work Cloud uses the Codex task-execution harness. Work and Codex share core
execution and isolation mechanisms, but their available tools, permissions, and
administrative controls aren't identical. The customer controls workspace
access, approved connections, and information intentionally supplied to a task;
OpenAI manages the hosted execution environment.

Work Cloud runs on shared, OpenAI-managed infrastructure. In the current
supported execution path, tasks run in VM-backed sandboxes, with execution state
associated with the authenticated account user in the workspace. Work can reuse
an environment across tasks or replace it while preserving eligible state. This
doesn't mean every task receives a new container or that each customer has a
dedicated physical host. Customers don't provide, host, or manage Work Cloud
containers.

## What a cloud task can access

A cloud task can use information made available through an authorized path:

- Information a person enters into a conversation.
- Files intentionally uploaded, attached from Library, or made available
  through a project.
- Content retrieved through an enabled app and an authorized account
  connection.
- Website content accessed through an enabled cloud browser or another
  permitted web capability, subject to applicable access controls.

A cloud task doesn't directly inherit access to local files, installed
applications, or the user's browser session. A device's access to a corporate
VPN, internal website, or private network doesn't grant the cloud task that
access.

An authorized connection can make information from an internal system available
through its own access path. That connection doesn't give the cloud task
unrestricted access to the employee's device or network.

## Apps, plugins, and connected accounts

An app can give Work access to information or actions in another system. A
plugin can use an app as one of its underlying tools. Making a plugin available
doesn't automatically enable the underlying app, authorize an account, or
approve every action the integration can perform.

A task that uses a connected app, directly or through a plugin, can proceed
only when:

- The workspace enables the app and any plugin that requires it.
- The person has the necessary workspace or role access.
- The connection uses an authorized individual, shared, or agent-owned
  account.
- The connected account, approved scopes, and available app action settings
  permit the requested information or operation.

For apps that support **Action control**, administrators can allow read-only
actions, all actions, or a custom set. **App permissions** control when
ChatGPT asks for confirmation to work with an app. Depending on the app and
workspace, options can include **Always ask**, **Any changes**, **Important
actions**, and **Never ask**. With **Any changes**, supported reads can proceed
without a prompt while changes require confirmation.

An authorized write can run without a prompt when the configured policy allows
it. This doesn't expand the app's allowed actions, workspace access, or the
connected account's permissions. ChatGPT can still block some high-risk
actions.

Confirm the plugin and each underlying app are available in the workspace.
Review role access, connected-account authorization, and action permissions as
distinct decisions. See
[Plugin controls](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/apps-and-connectors).

### Personal and shared connections

A personal connection uses the connected employee's permissions in the source
system. A shared or agent-owned connection uses the permissions of its
connected account instead. That account might access information or perform
actions that the requesting person couldn't access with a personal account.

Before enabling a shared connection, limit the account's permissions and
scopes, choose who can use it, and review the actions it can perform. See
[Workspace Agent connections and permissions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001143-chatgpt-workspace-agents-for-enterprise-and-business).

Content retrieved from a connected app isn't automatically saved as a Library
file. If the content is later saved to a conversation, project, Library, or
synced index, that copy follows the rules for its saved location.

## Cloud browser and network access

The cloud browser, web search, connected apps, and code or shell networking are
separate capabilities. Restricting one doesn't automatically disable the
others.

### Cloud browser

The cloud browser is a hosted tool a Work task can use to interact with
websites. Opening ChatGPT in a web browser or desktop app doesn't enable cloud
browsing; a cloud task can run without it.

The hosted browser doesn't inherit the user's local browser profile, open tabs,
existing sign-ins, saved passwords, password manager, or browsing history.
Where supported, users can sign in separately through a secure hosted sign-in
flow. This doesn't grant access to their local browser session.

Supported website interactions can include public forms and can combine
information from an authorized app with a website task. Where available,
website permissions include **Always ask**, **Auto approve**, and **Always
allow**. **Auto approve** applies automated risk checks; **Always allow**
removes the interactive website-access review. Neither grants new app
permissions or approves every action on a website. Consequential actions can
still require separate confirmation.

For a Work task to use the cloud browser in an Enterprise workspace,
administrators must enable both Work access and cloud browser access. See
[Using cloud browser in ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001280-using-cloud-browser-in-chatgpt).

### Code and shell networking

Public internet access for code or shell execution follows its own network
policy. When public internet access is off, network destinations required for
ChatGPT Work can remain reachable through a managed destination allowlist.

The allowlist governs network destinations, not shell commands. Disabling
public internet access for code or shell execution doesn't, by itself, disable
the cloud browser, web search, or connected apps. Changes to the network
setting apply after the current code run or shell command finishes and the
execution environment refreshes.

See [Code and shell sandboxing](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/sandboxing?surface=web).

## Data handling and retention

Work Cloud follows the applicable ChatGPT workspace privacy and security
protections described above. See
[Enterprise privacy](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy/).

Information associated with a cloud task doesn't follow one universal
retention schedule:

| Data category                        | Retention and deletion behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Work conversations                   | Follow the workspace conversation-retention settings. Deleted chats are generally scheduled for permanent deletion within 30 days, subject to published security, legal, and de-identification exceptions.                                                                                |
| Hosted execution state and snapshots | Follow a separate lifecycle from conversations and files. Access to execution state is scoped to the account user, and the workspace conversation-retention setting informs eligible stored snapshots. Ending a task or deleting a chat doesn't immediately purge every related artifact. |
| Files saved to Library               | Uploaded or generated files follow applicable Library and workspace retention rules. Deleting a conversation doesn't delete a file saved to Library.                                                                                                                                      |
| Project files                        | Remain associated with their project until removed or the project is deleted, subject to applicable deletion rules.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Saved memories, when enabled         | Follow separate memory controls. Deleting a conversation doesn't necessarily delete an existing saved memory.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Transient uploads                    | Eligible temporary Enterprise uploads outside Library can expire after 48 hours unless another applicable retention setting applies.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Connected-app content                | Source-system records follow that system's policies. Copies saved to a conversation, project, Library, or synced index follow the rules for their saved location.                                                                                                                         |
| Cloud browser data                   | Hosted browser data is separate from local browser data. Users can remove saved cloud browser cookies through the applicable settings.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Compliance records                   | Compliance Logs Platform records are available for 30 days. Exported copies follow the receiving system's retention policy.                                                                                                                                                               |

Deleting a conversation, removing a Library file or saved memory,
disconnecting an app, and clearing hosted browser data are separate actions.
Review the relevant storage location instead of assuming one action removes
every copy. See
[Chat and file retention policies](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8983778-chat-and-file-retention-policies-in-chatgpt).

Retaining appropriate conversation and execution context can help Work resume
interrupted tasks, refer to previous steps, and produce more consistent results.
Shorter retention or deletion can reduce that continuity, so choose settings
that balance security requirements with the usefulness of the workflow.

Eligible Enterprise and Edu workspaces can use Enterprise Key Management for
supported stored content, including supported hosted execution snapshots when
customer-managed encryption is required. Coverage varies by data category and
deployment. Rotating a key doesn't delete existing data or, by itself, deny
access to earlier encrypted content. Revoking or disabling key access is a
separate action that can disrupt supported workflows. Neither replaces a
retention or deletion policy.

Data residency and inference residency apply only to eligible content and
supported workloads, subject to the organization's agreement, region, and
configuration. Connected apps, external providers, and some processing or
synced indexes can follow separate location rules. Verify support for the
product, integration, and region. See
[Data residency and inference residency](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9903489-data-residency-and-inference-residency-for-chatgpt).

OpenAI API [Zero Data Retention](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/your-data#zero-data-retention)
is an API-specific control and doesn't define retention for ChatGPT Work.

## Administrator access controls

Review the controls that apply to each part of a cloud task:

- **Work Cloud and Work Local:** Where independent controls are available,
  manage cloud and local Work as distinct controls in **Workspace settings** >
  **Permissions & roles**. In other workspaces, local Work can share a control
  with Codex Local.
- **Apps and plugins:** Choose which integrations are available and which
  people or roles can use them.
- **Connected-account actions:** Review account permissions, application
  scopes, and available action or confirmation controls.
- **Browser and networking:** Assess cloud browser access and code or shell
  public-network access independently.

Enable **Work Cloud** only for approved users or groups. Where separate
**Work Cloud** and **Work Local** controls are available, enable **Work Cloud**
and disable **Work Local** for the intended role to permit cloud Work without
local execution. Where local Work and Codex share a control, review the effect
on both before disabling local execution. These controls don't prevent an
authorized person from intentionally uploading a file to a cloud task.

For supported role permissions with **Default**, **On**, and **Off** states,
**Default** inherits the workspace setting, **On** grants access, and **Off**
removes access through that role. If a user has multiple custom roles, another
role can still grant access. Some Work and plugin settings use different,
two-state controls. Verify effective access across all assigned roles. See
[Role-based access control](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11750701-rbac).

Where available, the **Work Cloud** permission applies across supported web,
mobile, and desktop experiences. It doesn't independently select which of those
surfaces can run cloud tasks. Consider device-management or other access
controls if a deployment must exclude a particular surface.

## Audit and compliance visibility

For eligible Enterprise and Edu workspaces, the Compliance Logs Platform can
include supported Work prompts and responses. Connected-app calls have separate
logs, and available source-system audit records vary by integration.
Supported compliance endpoints can provide access to eligible Library files.

Coverage depends on the event and the system where it occurs. Don't assume
every shell command, browser interaction, app invocation, file operation, or
approval appears in a customer-visible compliance export.

Endpoint monitoring can observe the ChatGPT client or network traffic on managed
devices, but can't inspect actions inside the hosted execution environment. Use
supported Work, compliance, and connected-system records instead.

Review current compliance event coverage alongside workspace reporting,
connected-system audit logs, and the retention policies of systems receiving
exported records. See the
[OpenAI Compliance Platform](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9261474-compliance-api-for-chatgpt-enterprise-edu-and-chatgpt-for-teachers).

## Start with a small pilot

Choose one practical task for a small group. For example, a security team could
compare an approved vendor advisory with an authorized inventory and review a
draft exposure assessment before deciding what to do. If cloud browsing or
connected apps are unavailable, provide the advisory and an approved inventory
extract directly.

Enable only the access the task requires. Confirm connected-account
permissions, retention settings, available audit records, and where a person
should review the result before expanding access. For rollout planning, see the
[Admin rollout guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/admin-setup).
