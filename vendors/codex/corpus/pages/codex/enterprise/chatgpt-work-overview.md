# ChatGPT Work Overview

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](https://learn.chatgpt.com/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

ChatGPT Work and Codex share core execution, isolation, and permission
mechanisms, and fall within the same security boundaries that are part of your
ChatGPT Business or Enterprise agreement. The capabilities and controls
available to each experience depend on whether a task runs locally or in the
cloud, its available tools, and applicable workspace policies.

ChatGPT Work can complete multi-step tasks using the information, files,
applications, and tools available to an authorized workspace member. On the web,
those tasks run in the cloud, not on the member's device.

This overview explains the execution boundary, network and application controls,
data handling, and how tasks are executed securely using ChatGPT Work on the
web. Availability and administrative controls depend on your plan and workspace
configuration.

For a focused review of hosted execution, connected-account permissions,
browser and network settings, retention, and audit visibility, see
[ChatGPT Work cloud security](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/chatgpt-work-cloud-security).

For device access, local browser sessions, managed policies, and local data
handling, see
[ChatGPT Work local security](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/chatgpt-work-local-security).

## Execution isolation, files, and device access

The files and tools available to ChatGPT Work depend on where Work is running,
user permissions and admin configuration.

### Local Work

Local Work runs tasks through the ChatGPT desktop app on the user's device.
It can access local files, applications, and other resources made available to
it, subject to the user's permissions, applicable workspace controls, and device
security policies. Unlike Work on the Web, local Work can operate on resources
that remain on your computer without requiring you to upload files to a cloud
conversation.

### Cloud Work

Cloud Work is available on supported web, mobile, and desktop surfaces. It runs
the Codex harness in an isolated environment on OpenAI-managed infrastructure.
Cloud conversations can sync across these surfaces, and supported tasks can
continue while the user is away from the conversation.

Work on the web can't directly access files, applications, or open browser tabs
on the user's computer. A user can provide files by uploading them, adding them
to a supported project, or using an authorized connected app. The desktop
experience controls local file and application access through its own
permissions.

When
[Library](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001052-file-storage-and-library-in-chatgpt)
is available, eligible uploaded or generated files can be saved there.
Administrators can control whether ChatGPT automatically references saved
Library files. Disabling automatic references does not prevent users from
explicitly accessing or attaching files they are authorized to use.

and
[File storage and Library in ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001052-library-for-chatgpt).

## Network access and external destinations

Work uses tools like code/shell execution and the cloud browser to complete
tasks. Each of these tools has configurable permissions.

- **Code and shell commands**: Public internet access depends on the applicable
  workspace policy and individual Work network setting. When public internet
  access isn't allowed, commands can still reach OpenAI-approved destinations
  required for Work to function. This controls network destinations, not which
  commands can run.
- **Web search**: Search has controls separate from the Work code and shell
  network setting.

When available, the individual code and shell setting appears under
**Settings** > **Data controls** > **Work network access**. Turning on **Allow
public internet access** doesn't override an applicable administrator
restriction. Turning it off limits code and shell commands to required
destinations on the managed allowlist; it doesn't disable connected apps, web
search, or the cloud browser.

Changes to the code and shell network setting take effect after the current run
finishes and Work refreshes its execution environment. See
[Code and shell sandboxing](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/sandboxing?surface=web) and
[Work access controls](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001275-chatgpt-work-and-codex).

Outgoing interaction controls are separate from
[workspace IP access restrictions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/12111596-ip-allowlisting-for-chatgpt),
which limit incoming access to the ChatGPT workspace or Compliance API.

## Cloud browser and website access

The
[Cloud Browser](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001280-using-cloud-browser-in-chatgpt)
is one of the tools ChatGPT Work can use and is distinct from the
[In-app Browser](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001277-using-the-built-in-browser-in-the-chatgpt-desktop-app).
It operates remotely and uses a browser session separate from the user's local
browser. It can't access local tabs, extensions, browsing history, saved
passwords, or authenticated local sessions.

The cloud browser can navigate public websites, enter information into supported
public forms, and combine relevant information from an approved app with a
website task. Website sign-in through the cloud browser isn't available in
Enterprise or Edu workspaces. Browser availability depends on your plan,
region, rollout, and workspace permissions.
For Enterprise workspaces, an administrator must enable cloud browser access in
addition to Work access.

Website access and actions have separate controls:

- By default, ChatGPT asks before visiting a new website. Where available, users
  can select **Always ask**, **Auto approve**, or **Always allow**, and allow or
  block individual websites. **Auto approve** applies automated risk checks.
  **Always allow** removes the interactive website-access review. Administrators
  have the same ability to limit approval settings for users (for example,
  disable **Always allow** workspace-wide).
- Allowing a website doesn't approve every action on that site. ChatGPT can
  request a separate confirmation before actions that could create a financial,
  legal, account, or other consequential commitment.

Users can inspect available page screenshots and browser replay in a Work
conversation. These user-visible records don't establish Compliance API export
or a complete administrator-visible execution history.

See
[Using cloud browser in ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001280-using-cloud-browser-in-chatgpt)
and [Browser](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/browser?surface=web).

## Connected applications, credentials, and permissions

A connected app or Plugin gives Work access only through the integration your
workspace allows and the permissions granted for that connection. Admins can
control Plugin and app availability, workspace role access, external
authorization, action settings, and source-system permissions within the admin
dashboard.

For Enterprise and Edu workspaces, plugins and their underlying apps are off by
default. For Business workspaces, plugins and apps are on by default. Making a
plugin available doesn't automatically enable its required app or grant access
to an account. The required connection must be authorized for an individual,
shared, or agent-owned account before ChatGPT Work can access it. A shared or
agent-owned connection uses the connected account's source-system permissions,
which can differ from the requesting user's permissions.

Where supported, administrators can restrict an app to read-only actions or an
approved set of actions. App permission settings can also determine whether
ChatGPT asks before using an app, making changes, or performing important
actions. Not every app supports the same action controls, and not every action
requires an individual human confirmation.

For synced apps, changes to source content or permissions can take time to
appear. Disconnecting an app doesn't automatically remove information already
saved in a conversation, generated file, or record with its own retention
policy.

## Privacy and data handling

ChatGPT Work follows the privacy, security, and data-handling policies
applicable to your ChatGPT workspace. Conversations, uploaded files, generated
files, connected applications, and browser data can have different retention and
deletion rules.

For details, see [Enterprise privacy](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy/),
[Chat and file retention policies](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8983778-chat-and-file-retention-policies-in-chatgpt),
[Data residency and inference residency](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9903489-data-residency-and-inference-residency-for-chatgpt),
and the [ChatGPT Work Admin FAQ](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/work-admin-faq).

### Retention depends on the data type

- **Work conversations:** Follow the applicable ChatGPT workspace conversation
  retention and deletion settings.
- **Files saved to Library:** Follow the applicable file and workspace
  retention rules. Deleting a conversation doesn't delete files stored in
  Library.
- **Project files:** Remain with the project until its deletion, subject to the
  applicable deletion rules and exceptions.
- **Transient uploads outside Library:** For Enterprise, transient uploads can
  expire after 48 hours unless a different retention setting applies.
- **Saved memories, when enabled:** Follow separate memory controls.
- **Cloud browser cookies:** Remain separate from local browser data. Users can
  clear them from the Cloud browser settings.
- **Compliance Logs Platform records:** Remain available in the platform for 30
  days. Exported copies follow the receiving system's retention policy.
- **Connected application data:** Source records follow the connected
  application's policies. Copies saved in a chat, file, or synced index also
  follow the applicable OpenAI storage and retention rules.

Deleting a conversation, ending a Work task, clearing browser cookies, and
retaining compliance records are different operations. Deleting a chat removes
it from view and schedules permanent deletion within 30 days, subject to the
published security, legal, and de-identification exceptions.
