# Roles and workspace permissions

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](https://learn.chatgpt.com/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

Different settings cover different parts of your organization's ChatGPT
experience. Giving someone access in one area doesn't automatically give them
access in another. Use this page to see how the six control boundaries work
together, then follow the linked guidance for current setup steps.

In workspace settings, **Codex and Work Local** combines local Codex and Work
access under **Allow members to use Codex and Work Locally**. Other workspaces
separate **Codex Local** and **Work Local** into independent sections. In that
layout, **Allow members to use Codex locally** grants local Codex access, and
**Use Work locally** grants local Work access. Enabling one doesn't grant
access to the other. These labels identify workspace permissions, not separate
products or clients. Token permissions and credential lifetime limits appear
in either an **Access tokens** section or the local-access section, depending
on the workspace. Managed configuration is a separate layer that constrains
supported runtime behavior for covered capabilities in those clients. Features
and effective requirements can differ by client and version.

## Understand the control boundaries

A request must pass every boundary that applies to it. For example, workspace
access can make a plugin available, but the connected service still decides which
data the signed-in account can read. A local permission profile can restrict a
run in a supported local client, but it can't grant a workspace feature or
model.

## Assign workspace access

ChatGPT workspace administration separates product access from administrative
authority.

### Understand the difference between a seat, an admin role, and a custom role

A seat determines which product surfaces a member can access. Depending on the
workspace plan, available seat types can include ChatGPT and Codex seats.

Built-in workspace roles determine administrative authority. The **Owner** role
manages workspace-wide settings, the **Admin** role manages supported operations
and groups, the **Member** role doesn't have administrative rights, and the
**Analytics Viewer** role can access workspace analytics.

Custom roles define which supported features a member can use. They don't
replace seat or plan eligibility, grant permissions in a connected system, or
change local runtime requirements.

  ></iframe>



### Set the workspace default, then create targeted custom roles

Only workspace owners can configure role-based access control (RBAC) and create
custom roles. Workspace settings establish the baseline for eligible
permissions. Workspace owners can assign custom roles through groups or
directly to individual members where supported. Groups can be manually managed
or SCIM-synced, and a member can receive more than one custom role.

For eligible permissions, **Default** inherits the workspace setting, **On**
grants access, and **Off** explicitly denies access. An explicit **Off** in any
applicable role blocks access even when another role grants it. Available
permission states can vary by feature.

### Review Work Local and Work Cloud permissions

When your workspace offers **Work Local** and **Work Cloud**, check both the
workspace default and each applicable custom role. Work is available only to
eligible workspaces, and available controls can differ by plan, workspace
configuration, and rollout. A role can't expand the access allowed by a
member's seat.

**Work Cloud** governs supported ChatGPT Work tasks in the cloud. When the
controls are independent, **Work Local** without **Work Cloud** allows local
work in the ChatGPT desktop app but doesn't allow members to start cloud tasks.
Local Codex access uses **Allow members to use Codex locally** in **Codex
Local**. Changing **Use Work locally** doesn't change local Codex access or
replace local runtime requirements.

Some workspaces instead show the combined **Codex and Work Local** section. In
that layout, **Allow members to use Codex and Work Locally** controls both
products.

For current eligibility and settings, see
[ChatGPT Work and Codex](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001275-chatgpt-work-and-codex).

Because available seats, roles, and permissions change with product and plan
updates, use the Help Center for the current permission list and setup
procedure:

- [Manage members, seat types, roles, and access](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8266401-managing-members-seat-types-roles-and-access-in-chatgpt-enterprise)
- [Configure role-based access control](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11750701-rbac)
- [Manage groups](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9083985-group-permissions-in-gpts)

### Control Computer History access

[Computer History](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/customization/computer-history) is off by default for
Business and Enterprise workspaces. Members cannot turn it on until a workspace
owner explicitly grants access. Enterprise workspace owners can grant access
by role:

1. Open [**Workspace Settings > Permissions & roles**](https://chatgpt.com/admin/settings).
2. Find **Computer History** and choose the workspace role that should have
   access.
3. Turn on **Enable Computer History** for that role.

This permission only allows assigned members to turn on Computer History; it
does not turn on the feature for them. Each member must opt in from the ChatGPT
desktop app on macOS and can choose which apps and websites contribute. Members
without the required workspace permission cannot enable the feature through
local settings.

## Apply local runtime policy

Local runtime policy constrains covered capabilities in the ChatGPT desktop
app, Codex CLI, and IDE extension. Cloud-managed requirements additionally
depend on supported ChatGPT sign-in and plan eligibility. Permission profiles
and managed requirements can constrain commands, filesystem access, network
access, approvals, and other local runtime behavior. They don't change the
user's seat, workspace role, model entitlement, or permissions in an external
system.

Users can select a built-in or custom permission profile when local policy
allows it. Administrators can distribute defaults and requirements through the
supported managed-configuration channels. See [Permissions](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/permissions)
for profile behavior and [Managed configuration](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/managed-configuration)
for requirements, delivery, and precedence.
