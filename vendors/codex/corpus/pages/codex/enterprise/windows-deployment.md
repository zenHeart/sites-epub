Users can install the ChatGPT desktop app themselves, or your IT team can
deploy it with an enterprise management tool. The app is Store-signed, but
users don't need to open the Microsoft Store to install or update it.

## Let users install and update the app

If users can manage their own applications, direct them to the
[web installer](https://get.microsoft.com/installer/download/9PLM9XGG6VKS?cid=website_cta_psi).
The installer provides the standard installation and automatic-update
experience. Microsoft Store components may appear during installation or
updates, but users don't need to browse the Store themselves.

You can also install the app from the command line:

```powershell
winget install --id 9PLM9XGG6VKS -s msstore
```

## Deploy the app with an enterprise management tool

If your organization centrally manages software, use Microsoft Intune or
another compatible mobile device management (MDM) or software-deployment
platform. If your platform supports Microsoft Store app deployment, search for
ChatGPT from OpenAI in the Store app flow, or use this Store product ID:

```text
9PLM9XGG6VKS
```

### Manage app updates

For setup instructions and rollout guidance, see
[Manage app updates](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/manage-app-updates).

## Install without Microsoft distribution services

If your environment can't use Microsoft app-distribution services for the
initial installation, download the Store-signed MSIX package for each device
architecture:

| Device architecture | Package                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| x64                 | [ChatGPT-x64.msix](https://persistent.oaistatic.com/codex-app-prod/ChatGPT-x64.msix)     |
| Arm64               | [ChatGPT-arm64.msix](https://persistent.oaistatic.com/codex-app-prod/ChatGPT-arm64.msix) |

These stable links point to the latest published Store-signed package for each
architecture. For offline deployment workflows that require a license file,
also download the
[offline license (`ChatGPT-License.xml`)](https://persistent.oaistatic.com/codex-app-prod/ChatGPT-License.xml).
Ingest the appropriate MSIX and, when required, the license file into your MDM
or software-deployment platform.

After the initial installation, devices that can reach
`persistent.oaistatic.com` can install updates automatically unless managed
configuration disables the app's built-in updater. If you disable in-app
updates, deploy newer packages through your MDM or software-deployment tool.

This deployment path:

- Supports initial installation in restricted environments.
- Supports x64 and Arm64 devices.
- Doesn't provide a standalone MSI or non-Store EXE.
