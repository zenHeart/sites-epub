#### Work with Grok Bot

# Create and manage Bots

A Bot is a durable AI teammate with a name, a job, its own conversation, and
working context that develops over time.

## Give each Bot a clear job

Create a separate Bot when the work has a distinct:

* Goal or area of ownership
* Set of tools and sources
* Working style
* Approval boundary
* Recurring schedule

Good jobs include **Talent Scout**, **Expense Manager**, and **Bug
Reproduction**. A job such as **General Helper** gives the Bot less guidance and
makes its saved context harder to reuse.

Describe the role in operational terms:

> Own the weekly account-health review. Pull product usage and support signals,
> flag evidence of churn or expansion, and produce a linked watch list for the
> customer-success team. Never contact a customer or change an account without
> approval.

## Create a Bot

1. Choose **New** in the sidebar or press `Cmd/Ctrl+N`.
2. In **New chat**, select **Create new agent**.
3. Grok Bot creates and opens a Bot named **New Agent**.
4. Open **Bot actions → Edit Profile** to set its name, title, description,
   and avatar.
5. Start a conversation with a concrete task.

Your existing Bots can also suggest or create a focused Bot when a job should
have a long-lived owner. Ask before creating several Bots if you want to keep
the roster small.

An account can have up to 50 Bots and group chats combined.

## Edit a Bot

Open the Bot menu to change its name or description. Update the description
when you discover a durable preference, boundary, or responsibility that should
shape future work.

Use the conversation for task-specific instructions. Use the description for
rules that should remain true:

* **Description:** “Never send external messages without approval.”
* **Message:** “Draft follow-ups for these twelve accounts.”

## Pin or hide a Bot

* **Pin** active Bots to keep them at the top of the sidebar.
* **Hide from sidebar** removes a Bot from the main list without deleting its
  work.
* Open **Show hidden chats** at the bottom of the sidebar, then choose
  **Unhide**, to restore a hidden Bot.

Hiding does not pause the Bot or its routines.

## Duplicate a Bot

Duplicate a Bot when you want the same role as a starting point for a different
scope—for example, one Account Health Bot per region.

The copy is named "`<name>` copy" and carries the profile, settings, enabled
skills, routines, and avatar. It does not copy conversation history, learned
memory, or chat attachments. Rename it and provide the new scope before
assigning work.

## Share a Bot

Share a public link when someone else should start from the same Bot.

1. Open the Bot and copy its share link.
2. Send the link. The recipient opens a preview on
   [x.ai](https://x.ai) and can choose **Add to Grok Bot**.
3. They need the Grok Bot app to finish adding it.

The link is public. Anyone who has it can view the Bot's shared configuration,
including its identity, description, skills, and routines. Remove API keys,
internal URLs, customer data, and anything else you would not put in a public
document before you share.

Adding a shared Bot creates a copy on the recipient's account. It does not give
them your computer, logins, or conversation history.

Shared Bots are created by other users, not by SpaceXAI. Adding one accepts the
[third-party bot terms](https://x.ai/legal/bot-sharing-terms).

## Delete a Bot

Deleting a Bot removes its active profile, conversation, and routines from Grok
Bot. Shared computer files and sign-ins are not isolated by Bot and may remain
on the computer. Backend retention follows the applicable Cursor terms.

If you may need the work later, hide the Bot instead.

## What a Bot remembers

A Bot can retain stable working preferences, important facts, and summaries
from its work. This helps it keep a role over time without replaying every prior
message.

Memory is not a substitute for an authoritative source:

* Keep changing facts in the source system
* Ask the Bot to cite or reopen current data for consequential decisions
* Correct stale assumptions directly
* Put explicit safety boundaries in the Bot description

Bots have separate roles and conversations, but they share the computer. They
can pass context through direct messages, group chats, and shared files.

## Organize a team of Bots

Start with the smallest useful roster:

1. Give one Bot ownership of an end-to-end outcome.
2. Add another Bot only when the work has a stable specialist role.
3. Put Bots in a [group chat](/grok-bot/chat-and-collaboration) when the handoff itself
   needs to be visible.
4. Keep external actions behind a clear approval boundary.

For example, a Website Launch group might include a launch coordinator, a
content editor, and an analytics reviewer. The coordinator can assign work,
while the group preserves the handoffs in one conversation.
