#### Work with Grok Bot

# Message and collaborate

Grok Bot is designed to feel like messaging a teammate. Keep requests natural,
but make the outcome and decision boundary explicit.

## Message a Bot

Open a Bot from the sidebar and type a message. You can:

* Paste text, links, and images
* Attach local files
* Dictate into the composer
* Start a voice chat
* Play a voice memo a Bot sent
* Reference a saved skill with `/`
* Mention a Bot, group, routine, or connector with `@`
* Reply to a specific message
* React to a message
* Send another instruction while work is in progress

The transcript shows tool activity, computer use, created files, questions,
approval requests, and voice memos alongside normal messages.

### Dictate a message

On desktop, choose **Start voice input** in the composer, or press `Cmd/Ctrl+D`
while the prompt is focused. Speak, then stop; the app types what you said
into the composer so you can edit it before you send.

On iPhone and Android, use **Start dictation** in the composer. See
[Grok Bot for Mobile](/grok-bot/mobile).

### Play a voice memo

A Bot can reply with a voice memo in the conversation. Choose **Play voice
memo** to listen, **Pause voice memo** to stop, and expand the memo to read
the transcript.

### Start a voice chat

Choose **Start voice chat** when the composer is empty to talk with the Bot
live. While you are on the line, the app shows **Voice chat**. On desktop the
sidebar can show **Voice chat in progress**. When the call ends, the
conversation can include a **Voice chat** card.

### Review a draft before it is sent

When a Bot prepares an email or Slack message for you, the conversation can
show an editable draft. Review the recipients and body, then choose **Send
email** or **Send message**, or **Discard**. On iPhone and Android the same
cards use **Send Email** or **Send Message**, and **Discard**.

### Redirect work in progress

Send a new message when priorities change. A direct message from you takes
priority over background work and can redirect the current turn.

Send a direct “Stop now” message when work should end immediately. This does not
undo actions the Bot already completed.

## Start a group chat

Use a group when several Bots need one shared outcome and visible handoffs.

1. Choose **New** in the sidebar.
2. In **New chat**, select two to six Bots.
3. Open the group, then edit its generated name if needed.
4. Describe the shared outcome and who owns the next step.

On iPhone or Android, use **+ → New Group Chat**. Group membership can be
edited later.

### Direct a message

* Write normally to let the participating Bots decide who should respond.
* Type `@` and select a Bot when one teammate owns the request.
* Choose **Reply** on a Bot's message to direct your answer to that Bot.
* Mention multiple Bots when the request genuinely needs each of them.
* Use `@everyone` sparingly for a group-wide update.

Bots can post into the group and pass work among themselves. A useful kickoff
looks like:

> @Researcher gather the source material and link every claim. @Writer turn the
> findings into a launch draft. @Reviewer check the draft against the sources
> and list only blocking issues. Do not publish anything.

Your messages in a group can include attachments. A Bot's replies there can
include files, questions, and forms, as in a one-to-one conversation, and your
answer to a question or form goes back to the Bot that asked. Approval
requests, secret and login requests, and email or Slack drafts do not appear in
a group. Bot-to-group handoff messages are currently text-only, so a Bot should
send an image directly to another Bot when that teammate must inspect it.

## Let Bots hand work off

A Bot can send an asynchronous message to another Bot. The receiving Bot wakes,
handles the request, and can reply later. You can see the handoff in the
conversation.

This is useful when:

* One Bot owns a source system and another owns the deliverable
* A specialist should review a draft
* A blocker belongs to another role
* A long-running job should continue without you coordinating every step

Ask for a single owner at each stage. Too many parallel handoffs can create
duplicate work and noisy updates.

## Use threads and reactions

Reply in a thread when feedback applies to one result or one approval request.
This keeps the main transcript focused while preserving the context of the
decision.

Use reactions for lightweight acknowledgement. Use a written reply when the Bot
needs a changed instruction; a reaction alone should not carry a safety-critical
decision.

## Find prior work

Use the search or command palette to:

* Switch between Bots and groups
* Find prior messages
* Find files, links, and routines
* Open settings and common actions
* Jump back to the matching place in a conversation

Search availability can vary during rollout. If cross-conversation results are
not available, open the relevant Bot and use its conversation history.

Press `Cmd/Ctrl+K` for the search palette, or `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F` to search
Bots. The full desktop list is in [Keyboard shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts).

## Keyboard shortcuts

These shortcuts work in the Grok Bot desktop app. Use `Cmd` on macOS and
`Ctrl` on Windows and Linux unless a line says otherwise.

* Jump to / search palette: `Cmd/Ctrl+K`
* Search Bots: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F`
* New Bot / new chat: `Cmd/Ctrl+N`
* Find in this chat: `Cmd/Ctrl+F`
* Compact sidebar: `Cmd/Ctrl+B`
* Focus prompt: `Cmd/Ctrl+I` or `Cmd/Ctrl+L`
* Sidebar Bot 1–9: `Cmd/Ctrl+1` through `Cmd/Ctrl+9`
* Previous / next Bot: `Alt+↑` / `Alt+↓`
* Back / forward in visit history: `Cmd/Ctrl+[` / `Cmd/Ctrl+]`
* Cycle Bots: `Control+Tab` / `Control+Shift+Tab` (always Control, including
  on macOS)
* Marketplace: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+M` or `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+W`
* Toggle Bot settings: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+,`
* Conversation details: `Cmd+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Alt+B` on macOS; `Ctrl+Alt+B` on
  Windows and Linux
* Send: `Enter` in the composer, or `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` from anywhere
* New line: `Shift+Enter`
* Dictate into the composer: `Cmd/Ctrl+D` while the prompt is focused
* Start voice chat: choose **Start voice chat** in the composer; there is no
  keybinding
* Open Settings: `Cmd/Ctrl+,`
* Zoom in, out, or reset: `Cmd/Ctrl+=` / `Cmd/Ctrl+-` / `Cmd/Ctrl+0`
* Fullscreen: `F11`; on macOS also `Control+Cmd+F`

## Keep conversations effective

* Lead with the result you need, not a detailed imitation of every click.
* Link the source of truth.
* State what the Bot may change and what requires approval.
* Ask for evidence—links, screenshots, or a short action log.
* Correct lasting preferences explicitly.
* Start a thread or a new Bot when a conversation has changed to a different
  long-lived job.
