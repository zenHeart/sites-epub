# Grok Bot for teams and enterprises

Grok Bot gives each person on your team standing Bots for everyday work:
research, operations, documents, browsing, and automations. This page is for
team and organization admins rolling Grok Bot out. Security reviewers should
start with [Grok Bot security](/grok-bot/security) and the
[Grok Bot security FAQ](/grok-bot/security-faq). Members who want the approval
model should start there too.

## Availability

| Plan | Access |
| --- | --- |
| Individuals | Included with every paid Cursor plan, or through an individual SuperGrok link |
| Teams | Included; every member has access, and usage follows the seat's allowance |
| Enterprise | Enable Grok Bot for your team from your dashboard |

That table is product access, not the admin control list. Grok Bot is included
on Teams. Several settings are Enterprise only and do not appear for
self-serve Teams. [Admin controls](#admin-controls) marks each one.

[Plans and billing](https://cursor.com/help/grok-bot/plans) is the canonical
plan and usage matrix.

## Enabling Grok Bot for your team

On the Teams plan, Grok Bot is enabled by default, and every member has access
without any admin action. It stays off for teams on Privacy Mode (Legacy) or on
a [legacy request-based plan](https://cursor.com/docs/models-and-pricing#legacy-request-based-pricing).
There is no switch to turn it off.

On the Enterprise plan, an admin turns it on from
[Grok Bot in the Cursor dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/bot). Once
enabled, you can give access to all team members or limit it to specific
groups with **Manage Group Access**. Turning Grok Bot off blocks every member
without deleting their computers.

Admins on either plan can bring members in with **Invite Team** on the Grok Bot
page. Existing Cursor users on your team get an email with a download link. New
users get an invitation to your Cursor team, by email or invite link, that also
points them to Grok Bot. Teams that manage membership through SCIM see only the
existing-users option.

## Before you roll out

* Move off Privacy Mode (Legacy). That setting blocks Grok Bot entirely, and
  you are prompted to change it before enabling. Check the privacy setting in
  Team Settings.
* Plan for shared egress addresses. If your company restricts services by
  source IP, see [static egress IPs](/grok-bot/security#static-egress-ips).
* Clear your gateway. If member devices sit behind Zscaler or another
  TLS-inspecting proxy, allow Cursor's domains, including the nested
  `*.*.cursorvm.com` pattern, and exempt them from inspection before members
  connect. See
  [Configure TLS-inspecting proxies](/grok-bot/proxies).
* Decide how members sign in to company tools from the computer. See
  [identity and sign-ins](/grok-bot/security#identity-and-sign-ins).
* Review the policies Grok Bot inherits: Team Rules and the connector policy on
  every plan, plus team Auto-review rules and the MCP allowlist on Enterprise.

## Architecture

### How Grok Bot is built

Grok Bot is a computer-use agent that operates applications, browsers, and
development environments. It runs in Cursor's cloud, and each user's work
executes on a dedicated cloud computer. The desktop and mobile apps are thin
clients for chat, review, and approvals.

The security model rests on four principles:

* Per-user isolation. Each user's work runs in a dedicated Firecracker microVM,
  a micro virtual machine with hardware-level separation from other users.
* No access by default. A Bot can use only the accounts and plugins the user or
  team grants it.
* Human approval gates. Sensitive actions require user approval, evaluated by
  an independent review model called Auto Review.
* Administrative control. Team admins can set Team Rules, Cloud Agent
  delegation, template sharing, and the local execution ceiling. Network
  Controls, Team Setup, Allow Local Egress, Action Recording, Enforce
  Auto-review, Auto-review rules, and the organization-wide enable switch are
  Enterprise only.

The pieces fit together like this:

1. Local machine. Chat, review, and approvals happen on the member's device.
   Work runs in the hosted computer. Optional
   [local execution](/grok-bot/security#local-execution) requires per-command
   approval by default and can be turned off.
2. Environment. One persistent Firecracker microVM per user. Every Bot that
   user runs shares that computer. Admins manage Grok Bot from the Grok Bot
   page of the [Cursor dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/bot). Team
   Rules, Cloud Agent delegation, public template sharing, and Execution on
   Local Computer are available to team admins. Enterprise only on that page:
   the organization-wide enable switch, Network Controls, Team Setup, Allow
   Local Egress, Action Recording, Enforce Auto-review, Auto-review rules, and
   computer management for organization admins. Members never see this page.
3. The Bot. Shell, browser, and computer use inside the hosted computer. A Bot
   has no access by default and acts only with accounts the member signs it
   into. It hands login, two-factor authentication, and payment steps to the
   member.
4. Plugins. Your team's Cursor MCP (Model Context Protocol) policy applies in
   full, allowing or blocking each connector. OAuth tokens stay on Cursor's
   connector backend, and Bots invoke tools without receiving them.
5. Cloud Agents. Grok Bot can delegate coding tasks to separate computers under
   your existing [Cloud Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent) controls.
   Admins can disable spawning.
6. Models and data. Cursor manages model selection. With Privacy Mode enabled,
   customer data is not used for training; Cursor enforces this on its servers,
   and when the setting cannot be verified, the system defaults to not training.

### How users are isolated

Each user gets a dedicated computer with hardware-level separation, and one
user cannot reach another user's computer. Every computer is a Firecracker
microVM with its own kernel, memory, and virtual devices.

Within one user, the boundary is different: all of that user's Bots share one
computer, and Bots isolate personalities and workspaces, not compute. Treat a
login or file on the computer as available to every Bot that user runs, sign
the browser out of accounts a Bot no longer needs, and remove sensitive
temporary files when work completes. When a workload needs its own computer and
credential set, give it its own Cursor user.

## Admin controls

Most Grok Bot settings sit on the Grok Bot page of the
[Cursor dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/bot), which only admins see. A
few live in Team Settings, your Team Marketplace, or your identity provider.
Several controls are available only on the Enterprise plan; the rest are
available on Teams and Enterprise.

### Access and identity

Who can use Grok Bot, and how members are provisioned.

#### Enable Grok Bot

The organization-wide switch on the Grok Bot page, with **Manage Group Access**
beside it. Turning it on opens a setup modal that covers privacy mode, pricing,
and model availability. Turning it off blocks every member without deleting
their computers. See
[Enabling Grok Bot for your team](#enabling-grok-bot-for-your-team).

Available on the Enterprise plan.

#### SCIM

SCIM 2.0 provisioning and deprovisioning through your identity provider.
Members sign in to Grok Bot with their Cursor account, so your existing
[SCIM](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim) and SSO setup carries over.
For Okta and Entra ID steps, including app assignment and sign-in rules for the
computer browser, see
[Configure identity and access](/grok-bot/identity-and-access).

Available on the Enterprise plan.

### Agent capabilities

What Bots may do on behalf of members. Each control applies to every member's
Bots.

#### Cloud Agents

Allows or blocks Bots delegating coding tasks to Cursor Cloud Agents. The
switch is on the Grok Bot page, applies to the whole team, and is on by
default. Delegated work runs on separate computers under your existing
[Cloud Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent) controls. Turn it off when
your team does not need delegation.

#### Public template sharing

Controls whether members can publish Bot templates outside your team. Off
keeps sharing team-only, and Cursor enforces the policy on its servers,
including for templates that are already public. Enterprise teams start with
public sharing off; other teams start with it allowed. For what a shared
template contains, see [Share a Bot](/grok-bot/bots#share-a-bot).

#### Connector policy

Grok Bot inherits your team's Cursor connector policy. There is no separate
Grok Bot connector list, and connectors appear as plugins in the app. Set which
servers members can use from your Team Marketplace on the dashboard's
[Plugins page](https://cursor.com/dashboard/plugins), not on the Grok Bot page.
The MCP allowlist is Enterprise only; see
[MCP server trust management](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/model-and-integration-management#mcp-server-trust-management).
Any permitted connector is available to every Bot a member runs, and a blocked
one shows as **Disabled by team admin**. Pushing connectors to members, whether
mandatory or default-on, is not available.

#### Execution on Local Computer

Caps what Bots may do on a member's own machine through the desktop app: open
files and run tasks. Pick **Always allow**, **Ask every time**, or **Never
allow** on the Grok Bot page. **Always allow**, the default, leaves the choice
to each member, whose own setting defaults to asking before every task. **Ask
every time** makes every local task ask for approval, and **Never allow** turns
local execution off for the whole team. A member's own setting still applies
when it is stricter than the team's. Pick **Never allow** unless Bots have a
specific reason to work on member machines. See
[local execution](/grok-bot/security#local-execution).

#### Allow Local Egress

Let members route Grok Bot's web traffic through their own computer. Off
disables the option in Grok Bot. The switch is on by default. Turning it off
stops active routes within five minutes. Turning it back on restores each
member's previous choice. See
[Route traffic through your desktop](/grok-bot/settings-and-notifications#route-traffic-through-your-desktop).

Available on the Enterprise plan.

### Rules and approvals

Guidance Bots follow, and the review layer that stops actions.

#### Team Rules

Rules that every member's Bots follow. Add them from the Grok Bot page and
scope each rule to Cursor, Grok Bot, or both. Rules applied to Grok Bot are
always required, so members cannot turn them off. Keep them short and few, like
"never move company data to personal accounts." Rules guide a Bot; for approval
behavior, use [Auto-review rules](#auto-review-rules).

#### Enforce Auto-review

Prevents members from turning Auto-review off. The switch is on the Grok Bot
page and is off by default. When it is on, Bots always check risky actions
before running them and ask for approval when needed. Turn it on before you
rely on team Auto-review rules.

Available on the Enterprise plan.

#### Auto-review rules

Team-wide **Ask first** and **Allow automatically** rules that apply to every
member's Bots on top of their own rules. Add them with **Configure Rules** on
the Grok Bot page; changes save automatically. Members see the team rules under
**Settings → General → Auto-review** but cannot edit or delete them, and **Ask
first** wins when rules conflict. Turning enforcement off stops applying the
team rules. See
[approvals and Auto Review](/grok-bot/security#approvals-and-auto-review).

Available on the Enterprise plan.

### Computers and network

How team computers are set up, what they can reach, and how you recreate or
terminate them.

#### Network Controls

Restricts which destinations team computers can reach. Pick one of four modes,
from allow-all to a team allowlist of domains and IP ranges. Directory groups
can carry their own policy, and a lock makes the team policy apply to everyone.
Teams without a policy default to allow-all. See
[network policy](/grok-bot/security#network-policy) for the modes and how a
new policy reaches running computers.

Available on the Enterprise plan.

#### Team Setup

Manifests of install scripts that run on every team computer, so the same
tooling is present everywhere. Keep secret values out of setup scripts. Members
see the managed setup under
[Team Setup](/grok-bot/settings-and-notifications#team-setup) in the app,
where they can review or reinstall it. For how manifests run, and to install a
networking client that reaches private services, see
[Connect to private networks](/grok-bot/private-networks).

Available on the Enterprise plan.

#### Grok Bot Computers

Lets organization admins recreate or terminate the computers of many members
at once, with a result for each member. Team admin rights are not enough,
because one computer spans every team the member belongs to. **Recreate** moves
members to the latest image and Team Setup while keeping their Bots, files, and
logins. **Terminate** ends the member's current work and keeps the durable
disk; the member's next session starts a fresh computer on it. Neither action
removes access: to do that, remove the member from the team or turn off Grok
Bot for their group, and revoke their sessions in your identity provider. See
[Manage Grok Bot computers](/grok-bot/computers).

Available on the Enterprise plan.

### Logging and audit

What gets recorded, and where it goes.

#### Action Recording

Records Bot actions: connector (MCP) tool calls, shell commands, browser
navigations, and computer use sessions. Events are sanitized before they are
stored or exported. Shell commands are secret-scrubbed; browser navigations
keep each page as `scheme://host/path` with the title but strip query strings
and credentials; computer use sessions record action and screenshot counts and
the session duration, without the screenshots, clicks, or typed text. The
switch is on the Grok Bot page and is off by default. Recorded events do not
appear on the Audit Log page. To receive them in your own collector, configure
[OpenTelemetry Export](#opentelemetry-export), which delivers each event
tagged `cursor.surface=grok_bot`. Retention details are on
[logging and audit](/grok-bot/security#logging-and-audit).

Available on the Enterprise plan.

#### Audit logs

Admin, security, and authentication events, plus Grok Bot control-plane
events: Bot creation, member access changes, Team Setup manifests, MCP
authentication, Slack account links, and routines. Each row names the
application that acted, so you can filter the log to Grok Bot. View them on the
[Audit Log page](https://cursor.com/dashboard/audit-log) or stream them to
your SIEM; see
[audit logs](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring#audit-logs).
For the actions Bots took, use [Action Recording](#action-recording).

Available on the Enterprise plan.

#### OpenTelemetry Export

Streams Cursor usage metrics and logs, including recorded Grok Bot actions, to
a collector you run. It is the customer path for Action Recording events.
Configure it under **Team Settings → OpenTelemetry Export**. Endpoint
requirements and the event schema are on
[OpenTelemetry Export](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/opentelemetry-export).

Available on the Enterprise plan.

## Admin API

Enable Grok Bot and manage capabilities, Enforce Auto-review, group access,
network policy, team rules, and setup scripts through the
[Admin API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api#grok-bot).

## Security

The security model, network policy, approvals and Auto Review, identity,
logging, data handling, and certifications live on
[Grok Bot security](/grok-bot/security). Common review questions are on the
[Grok Bot security FAQ](/grok-bot/security-faq).

## Recommended configuration

For security-sensitive deployments, this is the recommended baseline.

For administrators:

1. Configure Network Controls. Enterprise only. Teams without a policy default
   to allow-all. Self-serve Teams cannot set this. See
   [network policy](/grok-bot/security#network-policy).
2. Audit connector policy in Teams Marketplace before enabling Grok Bot. Any
   permitted connector is available to every Bot a member runs.
3. Turn on Enforce Auto-review before you rely on team rules. Enterprise only.
   Members can add stricter personal rules on top, and **Ask first** wins when
   rules conflict.
4. Set Execution on Local Computer to **Never allow** unless Bots need to act
   on member machines. The default leaves the choice to each member.
5. Disable Cloud Agent spawning if you do not need delegation.
6. Keep public template sharing off unless members should publish Bot
   templates outside the team.
7. Add team Auto-review rules. Enterprise only. Cover actions that should
   always ask first or can proceed automatically. Production deployments,
   external email, payments, and accepting legal terms are good **Ask first**
   examples. Keep automatic rules narrow.
8. Gate sign-in to managed devices through your identity provider. Grok Bot
   sign-in uses your SSO, so a device-aware sign-in policy applies to it. This
   gates sign-in, not the hosted computer itself.

For members:

1. Never paste credentials into chat. The masked secret request is the
   supported path.
2. Prefer **Allow once** over **Always allow** for actions that touch accounts,
   money, or shared resources.
3. Sign the Bot's browser into accounts sized to the task, and sign it out of
   accounts it no longer needs. Use scoped service accounts where the source
   system supports them.
4. Start new roles with read-only tasks and draft outputs, and keep sending,
   publishing, purchasing, deletion, and production changes behind approval.
5. Review installed plugins and active routines regularly, and pause a routine
   when its source system changes.

## FAQ

### Can I turn Grok Bot on or off for my team?

The organization-wide **Enable Grok Bot** switch is Enterprise only. It lives
on the Grok Bot page of the Cursor dashboard. Self-serve Teams do not get this
switch. Disabling blocks members without deleting their computers.

### Can I manage Grok Bot through the Admin API?

Yes. Use the
[Admin API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api#grok-bot).

### Can I set a Grok Bot spend cap?

A separate Grok Bot spend cap is not available today. Account-level on-demand
controls apply, and the per-product split is on the
[dashboard usage page](https://cursor.com/dashboard/usage).

### Why does a member see a plugin as Disabled by team admin?

Your team's connector policy blocks that server. Enable it in Teams
Marketplace, add its server URL to your MCP allowlist if you use one, and have
the member restart the app. If a permitted plugin still fails for regular
members with a vendor-side permission error, check the provider's
requirements; some vendors restrict their MCP endpoints to their own
administrators. See
[Connect an app](/grok-bot/computer-and-apps#connect-an-app).

### How do members request access?

Members can send a request from the app. On a pooled Enterprise team whose
admin has not finished setup, members see a team-setup message instead. The
next step is for an admin to use the Enterprise only enable switch. Self-serve
Teams do not use that switch.

### Can I see what kind of work my team does with Grok Bot?

Yes, on Enterprise teams where it has rolled out. The Conversation Insights
page of the Analytics dashboard has a Grok Bot source that groups Bot
conversations by Type of Work and Level of Automation. See
[Grok Bot Conversation Insights](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/analytics#grok-bot-conversation-insights).

Isolation, egress, approvals, logging, and data-handling questions are on the
[Grok Bot security FAQ](/grok-bot/security-faq).
