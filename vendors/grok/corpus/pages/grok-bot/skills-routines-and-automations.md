#### Work with Grok Bot

# Skills and routines

Turn a successful task into a repeatable process. Grok Bot uses two building
blocks:

* A **skill** is a reusable set of instructions for how to do a task.
* A **routine** tells one Bot when to run a workflow—on a schedule or, where
  supported, after an event.

Start with a one-time task. Make it reliable, save the method as a skill, and
only then automate it.

## Save a skill

A skill captures steps, decision rules, expected output, and safety boundaries.
Skills are available across your Bots, although a Bot may need the relevant
connector or login to use one.

Ask:

> Save the process we just used as a skill called “Weekly account health.”
> Include the source systems, risk definitions, output format, and the rule that
> customer contact always requires approval.

A useful skill states:

1. When to use it
2. Required inputs and access
3. The sequence of work
4. How to validate the result
5. What to return
6. What requires approval

Use **Settings → Plugins** to discover and install supported connectors and
packaged skills. Type `/` in the desktop composer to reference a saved skill;
use `@` for Bots, groups, routines, and connectors.

Installed private skills can be enabled per Bot. If a skill does not appear in
the `/` menu, open it under **Settings → Plugins → Yours** and enable it for the
current Bot.

## Teach a workflow by demonstration

When **Teach a task** is available, you can demonstrate a browser workflow
instead of describing every step.

1. Open a one-to-one Bot conversation and its computer view.
2. Choose **Teach a task**.
3. Describe the result you are about to demonstrate.
4. Perform the workflow once.
5. Stop the recording and review the skill the Bot creates.
6. Test it on a safe example before scheduling it.

Teaching records visible computer interaction for up to ten minutes. It does
not record microphone audio. Avoid exposing secrets during the demonstration;
use the secure handoff flow for credentials.

The learned skill is a draft. Add decision rules, failure handling, and
approval boundaries that may not be obvious from one example.

Teach-by-demonstration may be enabled gradually. If the control is not visible,
ask the Bot to create a skill from written instructions and the completed task.

## Create a routine

Ask the Bot that should own the recurring job:

> Every weekday at 8:00 AM, run the Daily customer-risk skill against the
> current account list. Post a linked watch list in this conversation. Do not
> contact customers. If the source data is unavailable, report the failure
> instead of using old data.

Confirm:

* The owning Bot
* The schedule and time zone
* The input source
* The expected result
* The approval boundary
* What should happen when a source is missing

The Bot creates the routine and shows its next run. Background routines can run
while your laptop is closed.

## Trigger work from an event

Cursor account integrations can start a routine from an event, such as a Slack
message or a GitHub notification. They are separate from Slack or GitHub
plugins and may require their own connection flow.

Define a narrow matching rule and a clear response:

> When a message in `#customer-escalations` contains a support ticket link and
> the phrase “needs repro,” open the ticket, reproduce the issue in staging,
> and post a repro pack in this conversation. Never post back to Slack without
> approval.

Avoid broad listeners such as “every new message.” They create noise, consume
usage, and increase the chance of acting on irrelevant input.

## Test before enabling

Use **Test run** after creating or editing a routine.

> A test run performs real work. It can navigate websites, change files, and
> call connected tools. Use safe inputs and keep write actions behind approval.

Review:

* Whether it selected current inputs
* Whether the output meets the required format
* Whether every action has a source or audit trail
* Whether it stopped at the intended approval point
* Whether failure states are explicit

## Manage routines

Open the Bot, choose **View conversation details**, then open **Routines** to
view its routines and recent runs. You can:

* Enable or pause a routine
* Run a test
* Edit its schedule or instructions
* Inspect recent success and failure history
* Delete it

A Bot can own up to 50 routines, and the app keeps the 20 most recent run
records for each routine. Deleting a routine is immediate and has no undo.
Deleting a Bot also removes routines owned by that Bot.

To control unattended usage, Grok Bot may ask whether to keep routines running
after a long period away and pause them if there is no response. Review paused
routines when you return.

## Design routines for trust

* Automate preparation before execution.
* Have the Bot draft, reconcile, or recommend first.
* Require approval for sending, purchasing, deleting, publishing, or changing
  production systems.
* Include a no-data and stale-data policy.
* Make retries idempotent where possible.
* Tell the Bot where to report partial completion.
* Re-test after a website, connector, or source format changes.

and usage controls, and [Approvals, security, and
privacy](/grok-bot/approvals-security-and-privacy) for automation boundaries.
