## POST /v1/batches/\{batch\_id}/requests

Add multiple requests to an existing batch.

### Path Parameters

* `batch_id` (string, required) — The unique identifier of the batch

### Request Body

* `batch_requests` (array\<object>, required) — List of batch requests to add to the batch

  * `batch_request` (object, required)

    * `chat_get_completion` (object, required) — The chat request body for \`/v1/chat/completions\` endpoint.

      * `deferred` (boolean | null) — If set to \`true\`, the request returns a \`request\_id\`. You can then get the deferred response by GET \`/v1/chat/deferred-completion/\{request\_id}\`.

      * `frequency_penalty` (number | null) — (Not supported by reasoning models) Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

      * `logit_bias` (object | null) — (Unsupported) A JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

      * `logprobs` (boolean | null) — Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of message.

      * `max_completion_tokens` (integer | null) — An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion, only applies to visible output tokens (i.e. does not apply to tokens used for reasoning or function calls). Defaults to None, meaning the model will generate as many tokens as needed up until the model's maximum context length.

      * `max_tokens` (integer | null) — \\\[DEPRECATED\\] The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. Deprecated in favor of \`max\_completion\_tokens\`.

      * `messages` (array\<object | object | object | object | object>) — A list of messages that make up the the chat conversation. Different models support different message types, such as image and text.

      * `model` (string) — Model name for the model to use. Obtainable from \<https://console.x.ai/team/default/models> or \<https://docs.x.ai/docs/models>.

      * `n` (integer | null) — How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep n as 1 to minimize costs.

      * `parallel_tool_calls` (boolean | null) — If set to false, the model can perform maximum one tool call.

      * `presence_penalty` (number | null) — (Not supported by \`grok-3\` and reasoning models) Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

      * `reasoning_effort` (string | null) — Constrains how hard a reasoning model thinks before responding. Not supported by \`grok-4\` and will result in error if used with \`grok-4\`. Possible values are \`low\` (uses fewer reasoning tokens) and \`high\` (uses more reasoning tokens).

      * `response_format` (object | object | object)

      * `search_parameters` (object)

        * `from_date` (string | null) — Date from which to consider the results in ISO-8601 YYYY-MM-DD. See
          \<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601>.

        * `max_search_results` (integer | null) — Maximum number of search results to use.

        * `mode` (string | null) — Choose the mode to query realtime data:
          \* \`off\`: no search performed and no external will be considered.
          \* \`on\` (default): the model will search in every sources for relevant data.
          \* \`auto\`: the model choose whether to search data or not and where to search the data.

        * `return_citations` (boolean | null) — Whether to return citations in the response or not.

        * `sources` (array | null) — List of sources to search in. If no sources specified, the model will look over the web and X by default.

        * `to_date` (string | null) — Date up to which to consider the results in ISO-8601 YYYY-MM-DD. See
          \<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_8601>.

      * `seed` (integer | null) — If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same \`seed\` and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the \`system\_fingerprint\` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

      * `stop` (array | null) — (Not supported by reasoning models) Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.

      * `stream` (boolean | null) — If set, partial message deltas will be sent. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a \`data: \[DONE]\` message.

      * `stream_options` (object)

        * `include_usage` (boolean, required) — Set an additional chunk to be streamed before the \`data: \[DONE]\` message. The other chunks will return \`null\` in \`usage\` field.

      * `temperature` (number | null) — What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

      * `tool_choice` (string | object)

      * `tools` (array | null) — A list of tools the model may call in JSON-schema. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

      * `top_logprobs` (integer | null) — An integer between 0 and 8 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. logprobs must be set to true if this parameter is used.

      * `top_p` (number | null) — An alternative to sampling with \`temperature\`, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with \`top\_p\` probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. It is generally recommended to alter this or \`temperature\` but not both.

      * `user` (string | null) — A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help xAI to monitor and detect abuse.

      * `web_search_options` (object)

        * `filters` (object) — Only included for compatibility.

        * `search_context_size` (string | null) — This field included for compatibility reason with OpenAI's API. It is mapped to \`max\_search\`.

        * `user_location` (object) — Only included for compatibility.

  * `batch_request_id` (string | null) — User-provided identifier for the input request. If provided, it must be unique within the batch.
    Used to identify the corresponding result when the response is returned to the user.
    This is because the order of the returned results is not guaranteed to be the same as the order of the requests.

```json
{
  "batch_requests": [
    {
      "batch_request_id": "test_request_0",
