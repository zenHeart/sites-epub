# Videos

## POST /v1/videos/generations

Generate a video from a text prompt and optionally an image.
This is an asynchronous operation that returns a request\_id for polling.

### Request Body

* `aspect_ratio` ("1:1" | "16:9" | "9:16" | "4:3" | "3:4" | "3:2" | "2:3")

* `duration` (integer | null) — Video duration in seconds. Range: \[1, 15]. Default: 8.
  Also accepts \`seconds\` for OpenAI API compatibility.
  Accepts both number (8) and string ("8") values.

* `image` (object)

  * `file_id` (string | null) — File ID from the xAI Files API. Mutually exclusive with \`url\`.
    The file must be an image (JPEG, PNG, or WebP) and fully uploaded.

  * `url` (string) — Public URL or base64-encoded data URL of the image (JPEG, PNG, or WebP).
    Also accepts \`image\_url\` for compatibility.
    Required when \`file\_id\` is not set.

* `model` (string | null) — Model to be used.

* `output` (object)

  * `upload_url` (string, required) — Signed URL to upload the generated video via HTTP PUT.

* `prompt` (string) — Prompt for video generation. Required for text-to-video (T2V) and
  reference-to-video (R2V). Optional for image-to-video (I2V) — when
  omitted, the model generates a video from the image alone.

* `reference_audios` (array\<object>) — Optional reference audio clips (voice identity) for reference-to-video
  generation. Each entry supplies a clip via \`url\` or selects a voice via
  \`voice\_id\`; caller-supplied clips must be at most 15 seconds long. Only
  supported by select video models; at most 3 entries. May be provided
  without \`reference\_images\` (audio-only reference-to-video) — at least
  one reference of either kind selects the reference-to-video mode.

  * `url` (string | null) — Base64-encoded audio data URL (e.g. \`data:audio/wav;base64,...\`) or an
    http(s) URL to a downloadable audio clip of at most 15 seconds.
    Mutually exclusive with \`voice\_id\`.

  * `voice_id` (string | null) — Identifier of a first-party preset voice (e.g. "ara"; same voice
    identifiers as the TTS API), resolved server-side to a curated
    reference clip from the model's voice-preset catalog. Models configured
    for custom voices also accept a custom voice identifier. Mutually
    exclusive with \`url\`.

* `reference_images` (array\<object>) — Optional reference images for reference-to-video (R2V) generation.
  When provided generates video using these images
  as style/content references.

  * `file_id` (string | null) — File ID from the xAI Files API. Mutually exclusive with \`url\`.
    The file must be an image (JPEG, PNG, or WebP) and fully uploaded.

  * `url` (string) — Public URL or base64-encoded data URL of the image (JPEG, PNG, or WebP).
    Also accepts \`image\_url\` for compatibility.
    Required when \`file\_id\` is not set.

* `resolution` ("480p" | "720p" | "1080p")

* `storage_options` (object)

  * `expires_after` (integer | null) — Seconds from now until the file auto-expires. Maximum 2592000 (30 days).
    If omitted, the file does not expire.

  * `filename` (string, required) — Filename for the stored file.

  * `public_url` (boolean | object)

* `user` (string | null) — A unique identifier representing your end-user.

### Response Body

* `request_id` (string, required) — A unique request ID to poll for the result.

## GET /v1/videos/\{request\_id}

Get the result of a deferred video generation request.

### Path Parameters

* `request_id` (string, required) — The deferred request id returned by a previous video generation request.

### Response Body

* `error` (object)

  * `code` ("invalid\_argument" | "permission\_denied" | "failed\_precondition" | "service\_unavailable" | "internal\_error", required) — Machine-readable error codes for video generation failures.

    These are the codes that can appear in \`VideoError.code\` when polling a
    deferred video generation result. Authentication, model-not-found, and
    synchronous rate-limit errors are returned as HTTP errors and never
    appear in \`VideoError\`. Engine overload encountered mid-generation
    surfaces here as \`service\_unavailable\` (HTTP 503).

    Serializes to/from snake\_case strings (e.g. \`"invalid\_argument"\`,
    \`"internal\_error"\`) for JSON compatibility.

  * `message` (string, required) — Human-readable error message describing the failure.

* `model` (string | null) — The model used to generate the video. Omitted when status is "failed".

* `progress` (integer | null) — Approximate completion percentage for the video generation task (0-100).
  \- When status is "pending": progress is between 0-99, indicating current completion.
  \- When status is "done": progress is 100.
  \- When status is "failed": progress is omitted.

* `status` (string, required) — Status of the video generation: "done" when the video is ready.

* `usage` (object)

  * `cost_in_usd_ticks` (integer, required) — The cost of this request expressed in USD ticks.
    One USD cent equals 100,000,000 ticks, so one US dollar equals
    10,000,000,000 ticks.

  * `input_tokens` (integer | null) — Total input tokens: prompt text tokens + input image tokens
    (the sum of \`input\_tokens\_details\`, where \`cached\_tokens\` is a subset
    of \`text\_tokens\`, not additive).

  * `input_tokens_details` (object)

    * `cached_tokens` (integer, required) — Text tokens served from cache from previous requests (a subset of
      \`text\_tokens\`).

    * `image_tokens` (integer, required) — Input image tokens, as reported by the image engine.

    * `text_tokens` (integer, required) — Prompt text tokens consumed by the prompt-rewriting (upsampler) LLM,
      including any served from cache.

  * `output_tokens` (integer | null) — Total output tokens: rewritten-prompt text tokens + reasoning tokens
    \+ generated image tokens (the sum of \`output\_tokens\_details\`).

  * `output_tokens_details` (object)

    * `image_tokens` (integer, required) — Generated image tokens, as reported by the image engine.

    * `reasoning_tokens` (integer, required) — Reasoning (thinking) tokens generated by the prompt-rewriting
      (upsampler) LLM.

    * `text_tokens` (integer, required) — Rewritten-prompt text tokens generated by the prompt-rewriting
      (upsampler) LLM, excluding reasoning tokens.

  * `total_tokens` (integer | null) — Total tokens (input + output).

* `video` (object)

  * `duration` (integer, required) — Duration of the generated video in seconds.

  * `file_output` (object)

    * `expires_at` (integer | null) — Unix timestamp (seconds) when the stored file expires and will be
      automatically deleted. Only present when the file has an expiration.

    * `file_id` (string, required) — Files API file\_id of the stored file.

    * `filename` (string, required) — Filename of the stored file.

    * `public_url` (string | null) — Public URL for the stored file. Only present when the request included
      \`storage\_options.public\_url\` and creation succeeded.

    * `public_url_error` (string | null) — Human-readable error when \`storage\_options.public\_url\` was set but
      public URL creation failed. The file was stored successfully.

    * `public_url_expires_at` (integer | null) — Unix timestamp (seconds) when the public URL expires. Present when
      the public URL has an expiry, either from an explicit \`expires\_after\`
      in the request or inherited from the file's TTL.

  * `respect_moderation` (boolean, required) — Whether the video generated by the model respects moderation rules.
    The field will be true if the video respects moderation rules. Otherwise
    the field will be false and the video url field will be empty.

  * `storage_error` (string | null) — Human-readable error when \`storage\_options\` was set but the upload
    failed. Absent on success or when storage was not requested.

  * `url` (string | null) — A url to the generated video.
