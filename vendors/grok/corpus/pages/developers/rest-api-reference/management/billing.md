    * `endTime` (string) — The to-time in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (not including).

    * `timezone` (string) — The timezone that all timestamps are reported in.
      The timezone must be represented by the IANA time zone identifier (e.g. America/New\_York).

  * `timeUnit` ("TIME\_UNIT\_INVALID" | "TIME\_UNIT\_MONTH" | "TIME\_UNIT\_CALENDAR\_WEEK" | "TIME\_UNIT\_DAY" | "TIME\_UNIT\_HOUR" | "TIME\_UNIT\_QUARTER\_HOUR" | "TIME\_UNIT\_MINUTE" | "TIME\_UNIT\_SECOND" | "TIME\_UNIT\_NONE") — Time series are created by aggregating value into buckets we call \`TimeUnit\`.

    &#x20;\- TIME\_UNIT\_NONE: None means having one single time bucket for all events.
    This can be used to count total number of events ever for example.

  * `values` (array\<object>) — Name of the fields to aggregate.

    * `name` (string) — Name of the field to measure.

    * `aggregation` ("AGGREGATION\_NONE" | "AGGREGATION\_SUM" | "AGGREGATION\_AVG" | "AGGREGATION\_VAR" | "AGGREGATION\_STD" | "AGGREGATION\_MIN" | "AGGREGATION\_MAX" | "AGGREGATION\_P50" | "AGGREGATION\_P90" | "AGGREGATION\_P99" | "AGGREGATION\_P999" | "AGGREGATION\_COUNT" | "AGGREGATION\_COUNT\_DISTINCT") — Each value is an aggregate of the individual values in the time bucket. Note that not every field
      supports every aggregation method.

  * `groupBy` (array\<string>) — For each value of the group-by tuple, we return one time series.

  * `filters` (array\<string>) — All filter conditions are combined using AND.

### Response Body

* `timeSeries` (array\<object>) — For each value of the group-by clause, we return one time series.

  * `group` (array\<string>) — Values of the fields that were grouped by.

  * `groupLabels` (array\<string>) — Values to group the time series by.

  * `dataPoints` (array\<object>) — Data points ordered by timestamp. Data points are dense in the range provided (meaning we
    return one data point for every interval in the requested time range).

    * `timestamp` (string) — The timestamp (in UTC) when the data point was recorded.

    * `values` (array\<number>) — The values that were recorded at that datapoint.

* `limitReached` (boolean) — If this is true, the maximum cardinality of the query has been reached and only a subset of
  results is returned.
