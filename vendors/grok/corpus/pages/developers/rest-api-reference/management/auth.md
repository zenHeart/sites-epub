***

## POST /auth/teams/\{teamId}/api-keys

API keys are used to access the xAI API (https://api.x.ai). They are included on requests as a
HTTP Bearer token. API keys are bound to teams and are associated with the user who created
them.

### Path Parameters

* `teamId` (string, required) — ID of the team this API key belongs to. The team ID can be copied here:
  https://console.x.ai/team/default/settings/team.

### Request Body

* `name` (string, required) — Human-readable name for the API key. Should not be empty.

* `acls` (array\<string>) — By default API keys don't have access to anything. In order to actually use an API key, you
  must grant it access to (1) endpoints and (2) models.

  Access is granted via strings of the form \`api-key:endpoint:\[endpoint name]\` and
  \`api-key:model:\[model name]\` where \`endpoint name\` and \`model name\` can be retrieved via the
  \`/auth/teams/\{team\_id}/endpoints\` and \`/auth/teams/\{team\_id}/models\` endpoints respectively.

  ACLs also support wildcards. If you want to create an API key that has access to all models and
  endpoints, then add the two ACLs \`api-key:endpoint:\*\` and \`api-key:model:\*\`.

* `qps` (integer) — If set, the API key is limited to performing this number of queries per second.

* `qpm` (integer) — If set, the API key is limited to performing this number of queries per minute.

* `tpm` (string) — If set, the API key is limited to producing/consuming the set number of tokens per minute.
  The limiter engages when the limit is strictly exceeded. In-flight requests that cause the
  limit to get exceeded will not be aborted.

* `expireTime` (string) — Expiration time for the API key. If set and in the past, the key is rejected.

### Response Body

* `redactedApiKey` (string) — A redacted API key. We don't expose the full key after it has been created.

* `apiKey` (string) — Only set when the API key is created.

* `userId` (string) — ID of the User who created this API key.

* `name` (string) — Human-readable name for the API key.

* `createTime` (string) — Timestamp when the API key was created.

* `modifyTime` (string) — Timestamp when the API key was modified.

* `teamId` (string) — ID of the team this API key belongs to.

* `apiKeyId` (string) — The ID of the API key.

* `disabled` (boolean) — If API is disabled (by the user) or not. Users can disable API keys to prevent them from making
  API calls.

* `expireTime` (string) — Expiration time for the API key. If set and in the past, the key is rejected.

* `qps` (integer) — If set, this API key can only perform the stated number of requests per second.

* `qpm` (integer) — If set, this API key can only perform the stated number of requests per minute.

* `tpm` (string) — If set, the API key is limited to producing/consuming the set number of tokens per minute.
  The limiter engages when the limit is strictly exceeded. In-flight requests that cause the
  limit to get exceeded will not be aborted.

* `aclStrings` (array\<string>) — The permissions the API key has. By default, API keys don't have any permissions, which means
  all requests fail if this field is empty. There are two kind of permissions users can grant:
  (1) endpoints and (2) models via the \`api-key:endpoint:\[endpoint name]\` and
  \`api-key:model:\[model name]\` ACLs.

  If you want to grant access to specific endpoints and ACLs, you can use the corresponding
  \`/endpoints\` and \`/models\` endpoints to retrieve possible values for \`endpoint name\` and
  \`model name\`.

  If you want to create an API key that has access to all endpoints and models, you can use the
  wildcard ACLs \`api-key:endpoint:\*\` and \`api-key:model:\*\`.

\*\*Request example:\*\*

```json
{
  "name": "My API key",
  "acls": [
    "api-key:endpoint:*",
    "api-key:model:*"
  ]
