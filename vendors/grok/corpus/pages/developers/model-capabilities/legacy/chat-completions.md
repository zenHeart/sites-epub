# Chat Completions

> [!WARNING]
>
> Chat Completions is offered as a legacy endpoint. New features will come to the  first. To migrate, check out the [Migrating to Responses API](/developers/model-capabilities/text/comparison) guide.

Text in, text out. Chat is the most popular feature on the xAI API, and can be used for anything from summarizing articles, generating creative writing, answering questions, providing customer support, to assisting with coding tasks.

## Prerequisites

Create an API key on the [xAI Console API Keys Page](https://console.x.ai/team/default/api-keys?utm_source=docs\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=developers-model-capabilities-legacy-chat-completions\&utm_content=api-keys). Set your API key in your environment:

```bash
export XAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

## A basic chat completions example

You can also stream the response, which is covered in [Streaming Response](/developers/model-capabilities/text/streaming).

The user sends a request to the xAI API endpoint. The API processes this and returns a complete response.

```python customLanguage="pythonXAI"
import os

from xai_sdk import Client
from xai_sdk.chat import user, system

client = Client(
    api_key=os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY"),
    timeout=3600, # Override default timeout with longer timeout for reasoning models
)

chat = client.chat.create(model="grok-4.6")
chat.append(system("You are a PhD-level mathematician."))
chat.append(user("What is 2 + 2?"))

response = chat.sample()
print(response.content)
```

```python customLanguage="pythonOpenAISDK"
import os
import httpx
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="<YOUR_XAI_API_KEY_HERE>",
    base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1",
    timeout=httpx.Timeout(3600.0), # Override default timeout with longer timeout for reasoning models
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-4.6",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a PhD-level mathematician."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is 2 + 2?"},
    ],
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)
```

```javascript customLanguage="javascriptOpenAISDK"
import OpenAI from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
    apiKey: "<api key>",
    baseURL: "https://api.x.ai/v1",
    timeout: 360000, // Override default timeout with longer timeout for reasoning models
});

const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "grok-4.6",
    messages: [
        {
            role: "system",
            content: "You are Grok, a helpful and maximally truthful AI built by xAI."
        },
        {
            role: "user",
            content: "Explain how neural networks learn in two sentences."
        },
    ],
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message);
```

```javascript customLanguage="javascriptAISDK"
import { xai } from '@ai-sdk/xai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: xai('grok-4.6'),
  system:
    "You are Grok, a helpful and maximally truthful AI built by xAI.",
  prompt: 'Explain how neural networks learn in two sentences.',
});

console.log(result.text);
```

```bash
curl https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $XAI_API_KEY" \
-m 3600 \

        },
        {

```

## Conversations

The xAI API is stateless and does not process a new request with the context of your previous request history.

However, you can provide previous chat generation prompts and results to a new chat generation request to let the model process your new request with the context in mind.

An example message:

```json
{
  "role": "system",
  "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "You are a helpful and funny assistant."}]
}
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "Why don't eggs tell jokes?" }]
},
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "They'd crack up!" }]
},
{
  "role": "user",
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Can you explain the joke?"}],
}
```

By specifying roles, you can change how the model ingests the content.
The `system` role content should define, in an instructive tone, the way the model should respond to user request.
The `user` role content is usually used for user requests or data sent to the model.
The `assistant` role content is usually either in the model's response, or when sent within the prompt, indicates the model's response as part of conversation history.

## Image understanding

Some models allow images in the input. The model will consider the image context when generating the response.

### Constructing the message body - difference from text-only prompt

The request message to image understanding is similar to a text-only prompt. The main difference is that instead of text input:

```json
[
{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "What is in this image?"
}
]
```

We send in `content` as a list of objects:

```json
[
{
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
{
    "type": "image_url",
    "image_url": {
    "url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,<base64_image_string>",
    "detail": "high"
}
},
{
    "type": "text",
    "text": "What is in this image?"
}
    ]
}
]
```

The `image_url.url` can also be the image's url on the Internet.

### Image understanding example

```pythonXAI
import os

from xai_sdk import Client
from xai_sdk.chat import user, image

client = Client(api_key=os.getenv('XAI_API_KEY'))

image_url = "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/web-first-images-release.png"

chat = client.chat.create(model="grok-4")
chat.append(
    user(
        "What's in this image?",
        image(image_url=image_url, detail="high"),
    )
)

response = chat.sample()
print(response.content)
```

```pythonOpenAISDK
import os
from openai import OpenAI

XAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY")
image_url = (
"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/web-first-images-release.png"
)

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=XAI_API_KEY,
    base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1",
)

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image_url",
                "image_url": {
                    "url": image_url,
                    "detail": "high",
                },
            },
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "What's in this image?",
            },
        ],
    },
]

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-4",
    messages=messages,
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

```javascriptOpenAISDK
import OpenAI from "openai";
const openai = new OpenAI({
apiKey: process.env.XAI_API_KEY,
baseURL: "https://api.x.ai/v1",

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "grok-4",
    messages: [
        {
            role: "user",
            content: [
                {
                    type: "image_url",
                    image_url: {
                        url: image_url,
                        detail: "high",
                    },
                },
                {
                    type: "text",
                    text: "What's in this image?",
                },
            ],
        },
    ],
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
```

```javascriptAISDK
import { xai } from '@ai-sdk/xai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const result = await generateText({
model: xai('grok-4'),
messages: [
        {
            role: 'user',
            content: [
                {
                    type: 'image',
                    image: new URL(
                        'https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/web-first-images-release.png',
                    ),
                },
                {
                    type: 'text',
                    text: "What's in this image?",
                },
            ],
        },
    ],
});

console.log(result.text);
```

### Image input general limits

* Maximum image size: `20MiB`
* Maximum number of images: No limit
* Supported image file types: `jpg/jpeg` or `png`.
* Any image/text input order is accepted (e.g. text prompt can precede image prompt)

### Image detail levels

The `"detail"` field controls the level of pre-processing applied to the image that will be provided to the model. It is optional and determines the resolution at which the image is processed. The possible values for `"detail"` are:

* **`"auto"`**: The system will automatically determine the image resolution to use. This is the default setting, balancing speed and detail based on the model's assessment.
* **`"low"`**: The system will process a low-resolution version of the image. This option is faster and consumes fewer tokens, making it more cost-effective, though it may miss finer details.
* **`"high"`**: The system will process a high-resolution version of the image. This option is slower and more expensive in terms of token usage, but it allows the model to attend to more nuanced details in the image.
