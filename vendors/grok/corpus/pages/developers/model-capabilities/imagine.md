#### Model Capabilities

# Imagine Overview

The Imagine API lets you generate and edit images and videos with Grok Imagine models. Use it for image generation, image editing with up to 3 reference images, video generation from text or still images, video editing, and more.

## Pricing

Image generation uses flat per-image pricing regardless of prompt length. Each generated image incurs a fixed fee. Image edits are billed for both the input image and the generated output image. Video generation uses per-second pricing where both duration and resolution affect the total cost. For full pricing details, see the [pricing page](/developers/pricing#imagine-api-pricing).

## Image Generation

Generate new images from text prompts with Grok Imagine models. Configure output count (up to 10 images per request), aspect ratio, resolution, and response format.

```python customLanguage="pythonXAI"
import xai_sdk

client = xai_sdk.Client()

response = client.image.sample(
    prompt="A collage of London landmarks in a stenciled street‑art style",
    model="grok-imagine-image-2.0",
)

print(response.url)
```

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.x.ai/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $XAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-imagine-image-2.0",
    "prompt": "A collage of London landmarks in a stenciled street‑art style"
  }'
```

```python customLanguage="pythonOpenAISDK"
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)

response = client.images.generate(
    model="grok-imagine-image-2.0",
    prompt="A collage of London landmarks in a stenciled street‑art style",
)

print(response.data[0].url)
```

```javascript customLanguage="javascriptAISDK"
import { xai } from "@ai-sdk/xai";
import { generateImage } from "ai";

const { image } = await generateImage({
    model: xai.image("grok-imagine-image-2.0"),
    prompt: "A collage of London landmarks in a stenciled street‑art style",
});

console.log(image.base64);
```

## Image Editing

Edit a source image with natural language. Provide a public image URL or base64-encoded data URI, then describe the change you want Grok Imagine to apply. Multi-image editing supports up to 3 source images in a single request for combining subjects, transferring styles, and composing scenes.

```python customLanguage="pythonXAI"
import base64
import xai_sdk

client = xai_sdk.Client()

# Load image from file and encode as base64
with open("photo.png", "rb") as f:
    image_data = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode("utf-8")

response = client.image.sample(
    prompt="Render this as a pencil sketch with detailed shading",
    model="grok-imagine-image-2.0",
    image_url=f"data:image/png;base64,{image_data}",
)

print(response.url)
```

```bash
# Using a public URL as the source image
curl -X POST https://api.x.ai/v1/images/edits \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $XAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-imagine-image-2.0",
    "prompt": "Render this as a pencil sketch with detailed shading",
    "image": {
      "url": "https://docs.x.ai/assets/api-examples/images/style-realistic.png",
      "type": "image_url"
    }
  }'
```

```javascript customLanguage="javascriptAISDK"
import { xai } from "@ai-sdk/xai";
import { generateImage } from "ai";
import fs from "fs";

// Load image and encode as base64
const imageBuffer = fs.readFileSync("photo.png");
const base64Image = imageBuffer.toString("base64");

const { image } = await generateImage({
    model: xai.image("grok-imagine-image-2.0"),
    prompt: {
        text: "Render this as a pencil sketch with detailed shading",
        images: [`data:image/png;base64,${base64Image}`],
    },
});

console.log(image.base64);
```

## Video Generation

Animate a still image with a text prompt. The source image becomes the starting point for the generated video. Video requests are asynchronous: start a request, poll with the returned request ID, and use the completed video URL when ready. The xAI SDK and AI SDK handle polling for you.

```python customLanguage="pythonXAI"
import os
import xai_sdk

client = xai_sdk.Client(api_key=os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY"))

response = client.video.generate(
    prompt="Make the water crash down and slowly pan out the camera",
    model="grok-imagine-video-1.5",
    image_url="https://docs.x.ai/assets/api-examples/video/waterfall-still.png",
    duration=12,
)

print(response.url)
```

```javascript customLanguage="javascriptAISDK"
import { xai } from "@ai-sdk/xai";
import { experimental_generateVideo as generateVideo } from "ai";

const result = await generateVideo({
    model: xai.video("grok-imagine-video-1.5"),
    prompt: {
        image: "https://docs.x.ai/assets/api-examples/video/waterfall-still.png",
        text: "Make the water crash down and slowly pan out the camera",
    },
    duration: 12,
});

const videoUrl = result.providerMetadata?.xai?.videoUrl;
console.log(videoUrl);
```

```bash
# Start the video generation request
REQUEST_ID=$(curl -s -X POST https://api.x.ai/v1/videos/generations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $XAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-imagine-video-1.5",
    "prompt": "Make the water crash down and slowly pan out the camera",
    "image": {"url": "https://docs.x.ai/assets/api-examples/video/waterfall-still.png"},
    "duration": 12
  }' | jq -r '.request_id')

# Poll until the video is ready
while true; do
  RESULT=$(curl -s https://api.x.ai/v1/videos/$REQUEST_ID \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $XAI_API_KEY")
  STATUS=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.status')
  if [ "$STATUS" = "done" ]; then
    echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.video.url'
    break
  elif [ "$STATUS" = "failed" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "expired" ]; then
    echo "Request $STATUS"; echo "$RESULT" | jq .
    break
  fi
  sleep 5
done
```

## More Capabilities

Beyond the top use cases above, the Imagine API supports several additional workflows:

* **[Multi-Image Editing](/developers/model-capabilities/images/multi-image-editing)** — Combine up to 3 source images in a single edit for compositing subjects, transferring styles, and building scenes from multiple references.
* **[Video Generation](/developers/model-capabilities/video/generation)** — Generate videos from text prompts with configurable duration (up to 15s), aspect ratio, and resolution.
* **[Video Editing](/developers/model-capabilities/video/editing)** — Modify an existing video with a text prompt while preserving the rest of the scene.
* **[Reference-to-Video](/developers/model-capabilities/video/reference-to-video)** — Guide a generated video with one or more reference images that influence the output without forcing the first frame.
* **[Video Extension](/developers/model-capabilities/video/extension)** — Continue an existing video from its last frame, combining the original and extension into one clip.
* **[Files API Integration](/developers/model-capabilities/imagine/files)** — Reference stored files as Imagine inputs by ID, persist generated assets to the Files API, and optionally create a permanent shareable public URL — all in a single request.
