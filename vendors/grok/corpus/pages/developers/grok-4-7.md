# Grok 4.7

Grok 4.7 is SpaceXAI's frontier model built for coding, agentic tasks, and knowledge work.

## Using the API

If you already have an [API key](https://console.x.ai/team/default/api-keys?utm_source=docs\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=developers-grok-4-7\&utm_content=api-keys), set the model name to `grok-4.7`:

```javascript customLanguage="javascriptAISDK"
import { xai } from '@ai-sdk/xai';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: xai.responses('grok-4.7'),
  prompt:
    'Find and fix the bug, then explain it: function median(a){a.sort();return a[a.length/2]}',
});

console.log(text);
```

```javascript customLanguage="javascriptOpenAISDK"
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.XAI_API_KEY,
  baseURL: 'https://api.x.ai/v1',
});

const response = await client.responses.create({
  model: 'grok-4.7',
  input: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content:
        'Find and fix the bug, then explain it: function median(a){a.sort();return a[a.length/2]}',
    },
  ],
});

console.log(response.output_text);
```

```bash customLanguage="bash"
curl https://api.x.ai/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $XAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "grok-4.7",
    "input": "Find and fix the bug, then explain it: function median(a){a.sort();return a[a.length/2]}"
  }'
```

```python customLanguage="pythonXAI"
import os
from xai_sdk import Client
from xai_sdk.chat import user

client = Client(api_key=os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY"))

chat = client.chat.create(model="grok-4.7")
chat.append(user("Find and fix the bug, then explain it: function median(a){a.sort();return a[a.length/2]}"))

response = chat.sample()
print(response.content)
```

## Important details

* **We highly recommend setting a [`prompt_cache_key`](/developers/advanced-api-usage/prompt-caching/maximizing-cache-hits)** (Responses API; `x-grok-conv-id` header on Chat Completions). It routes a conversation's requests to the same server, making cache hits reliable; without it you often pay full input price on a cache-cold server. See [What Breaks Caching](/developers/advanced-api-usage/prompt-caching/multi-turn) for common mistakes.
* **Long agent loops** additionally benefit from [context compaction](/developers/advanced-api-usage/context-compaction); for tool-heavy workloads see [function calling](/developers/tools/function-calling).
* **Encrypted reasoning is always returned on the Responses API.** `POST /v1/responses` responses from `grok-4.7` include `reasoning.encrypted_content` even when `include` does not list it, so multi-turn conversations keep the model's reasoning without extra configuration. Pass the reasoning items back unchanged in the next request's `input`; see [Encrypted reasoning content](/developers/model-capabilities/text/reasoning#encrypted-reasoning-content). Chat Completions is unchanged.

## Fast variant

Grok 4.7 Fast is the same model served on faster infrastructure. It costs 2x the standard token rates, or 1.5x for long-context requests. It's available only in Cursor and [Grok Build](/build/overview), and is billed through your plan there. It is not included in Grok Build's free tier. It is not available on the public xAI API. Rates are on the [Pricing](/developers/pricing#grok-47-fast-pricing-cursor-and-grok-build-only) page.

## Where it runs

* **xAI API**: get a key from the [console](https://console.x.ai/?utm_source=docs\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=developers-grok-4-7\&utm_content=console-home)
* **US regional endpoint**: also served at `https://us.api.x.ai/v1`, which keeps inference in the United States, with token usage priced at a 10% premium; see [Regional Endpoints](/developers/advanced-api-usage/regions)
* **Grok Build**: the default model of the [coding agent](/build/overview)
* **Cursor**: available on all plans
* **Model gateways**: OpenRouter, Vercel, and Cloudflare
