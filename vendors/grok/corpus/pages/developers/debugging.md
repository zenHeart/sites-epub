#### Getting Started

# Debugging Errors

When you send a request, you would normally get a `200 OK` response from the server with the expected response body.
If there has been an error with your request, or error with our service, the API endpoint will typically return an error code with error message.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If there is an ongoing service disruption, you can visit
> [https://status.x.ai](https://status.x.ai) for the latest updates. The status is also available
> via RSS at [https://status.x.ai/feed.xml](https://status.x.ai/feed.xml).
>
> The service status is also indicated in the navigation bar of this site.

Most of the errors will be accompanied by an error message that is self-explanatory. For typical status codes of each endpoint, visit [API Reference](/developers/rest-api-reference).

## Status Codes

Here is a list of potential errors and statuses arranged by status codes.
