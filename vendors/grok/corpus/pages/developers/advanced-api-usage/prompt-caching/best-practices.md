#### Prompt Caching

# Best Practices & FAQ

## Best practices

1. **Always set `x-grok-conv-id`** (or `prompt_cache_key` for Responses API) — Routes requests to the same server, maximizing cache hits.

2. **Use a stable conversation ID** — A UUID or your application's session ID works well.

3. **Never modify earlier messages** — Only append new ones. Any edit, removal, or reorder breaks the cache.

4. **Front-load static content** — Place system prompts, few-shot examples, and reference documents at the beginning where they form a stable prefix.

5. **Monitor `cached_tokens`** — If consistently 0, verify your conversation ID and message ordering.

6. **Handle cache misses gracefully** — Eviction and routing mean cache hits aren't guaranteed. Your application should work without caching.

## Supported models

Prompt caching is available on all `grok` language models. Check the [Pricing](/developers/pricing) page for details on which models support caching and their specific cached token pricing.

## FAQ

### Does caching affect output quality?

No. Caching only accelerates the prompt processing phase. The model's output is identical whether the prompt is served from cache or computed from scratch.

### How long do cache entries persist?

Cache entries can be evicted at any time due to server load or restarts. Use `x-grok-conv-id` to maximize retention by routing to the same server.

### Can I force a cache miss?

Yes — use a different `x-grok-conv-id` or omit the header entirely. This will route your request to a potentially different server where no cache exists for your prompt.

### Does caching work with streaming?

Yes. Prompt caching works with both streaming and non-streaming requests. The first empty token in a stream corresponds to the cache lookup and prefill phase.

### Does caching work with tool calls and function calling?

Yes. The cacheable prefix includes all messages up to and including tool call results. As long as the prefix remains unchanged, subsequent requests will benefit from caching.
