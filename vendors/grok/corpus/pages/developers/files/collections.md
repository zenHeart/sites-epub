#### Files & Collections

# Collections

Collections offers xAI API users a robust set of tools and methods to seamlessly integrate their enterprise requirements and internal knowledge bases with the xAI API. Whether you're building a RAG application or need to search across large document sets, Collections provides the infrastructure to manage and query your content.

> **Looking for Files?** If you want to attach files directly to chat messages for conversation context, see [Files](/developers/files). Collections are different—they provide persistent document storage with semantic search across many documents.

## Core Concepts

There are two entities that users can create within the Collections service:

* **File** — A single entity of a user-uploaded file.
* **Collection** — A group of files linked together, with an embedding index for efficient retrieval.
  * When you create a collection you have the option to automatically generate embeddings for any files uploaded to that collection. You can then perform semantic search across files in multiple collections.
  * A single file can belong to multiple collections.

## What You Can Do

With Collections, you can:

* **Create collections** to organize your documents
* **Upload documents** in various formats (HTML, PDF, text, etc.)
* **Search semantically** across your documents using natural language queries
* **Configure chunking and embeddings** to optimize retrieval
* **Manage documents** by listing, updating, and deleting them

## Getting Started

Choose how you want to work with Collections:

* [Using the Console →](/console/collections) - Create collections and upload documents through the xAI Console interface
* [Using the API →](/developers/files/collections/api) - Programmatically manage collections with the SDK and REST API

## Metadata Fields

Collections support **metadata fields** — structured attributes you can attach to documents for enhanced retrieval and data integrity:

* **Filtered retrieval** — Narrow search results to documents matching specific criteria (e.g., `author="Sandra Kim"`)
* **Contextual embeddings** — Inject metadata into chunks to improve retrieval accuracy (e.g., prepending document title to each chunk)
* **Data integrity constraints** — Enforce required fields or uniqueness across documents

When creating a collection, define metadata fields with options like `required`, `unique`, and `inject_into_chunk` to control how metadata is validated and used during search.

## Usage Limits

To be able to upload files and add to a collection you must have credits in your account.

**Maximum file size**: 100MB

Please [contact us](https://x.ai/contact) to increase any of these limits.

## Data Privacy

We do not use user data stored on Collections for model training purposes.

## Supported MIME Types
