# Settings

Grok Build offers a variety of configurations to suit your needs, many of which are made directly available in the TUI under `/settings`.

Settings are persisted under `~/.grok/config.toml` (on Windows, `%USERPROFILE%\.grok\config.toml`). To configure the default home directory, you can set `$GROK_HOME`.

For MCP servers, see [MCP Servers](/build/features/mcp-servers). For marketplaces, skills, and plugins, see [Skills, Plugins, and Marketplaces](/build/features/skills-plugins-marketplaces); for hooks, see [Hooks](/build/features/hooks).

## Scopes

| Scope | Path | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Environment | `GROK_*` (and related) variables | Session / CI overrides |
| User | `~/.grok/config.toml` (or `$GROK_HOME/config.toml`) | Personal defaults |
| Project | `.grok/config.toml` in the repo | Repo-shared MCP, plugins, and permission rules |
| Managed | `~/.grok/managed_config.toml`, `/etc/grok/managed_config.toml` | Enterprise-served defaults |
| Requirements | `~/.grok/requirements.toml`, `/etc/grok/requirements.toml` | Policy pins |

Project configs are limited to MCP servers, plugins, and permission rules, not full user configs. For scope merge order and managed deployments, see [Enterprise Deployments](/build/enterprise#configuration). Day-to-day [permissions](/build/features/permissions) and [sandbox](/build/features/sandbox) apply to individual use; managed locks and headless modes are under Enterprise.

## Verification

To confirm which configs are picked up by Grok Build, run the following command:

```bash customLanguage="bash"
grok inspect
```

## Example `config.toml`

Copy into `$GROK_HOME/config.toml`, or `~/.grok/config.toml` when `GROK_HOME` is unset. Prefer `/settings` for UI, notifications, and other in-app options.

```toml customLanguage="toml"
[models]
default = "grok-build"                       # recommended for coding / agent sessions
web_search = "grok-4.6"                      # model used by client-side web_search tool

[model."grok-4.6"]
model = "grok-4.6"                           # id sent to the API
base_url = "https://api.x.ai/v1"             # provider endpoint

description = "Grok 4.6 from xAI"
env_key = "XAI_API_KEY"                      # env var holding the API key
