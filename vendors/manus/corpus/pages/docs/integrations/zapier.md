# Zapier 

> Connect Manus to 8,000+ apps with no-code automation

## What is Manus for Zapier?

Manus for Zapier allows you to connect Manus with over 8,000 apps and services using visual, no-code workflows. When something happens in one app (like a new email, form submission, or calendar event), you can automatically trigger a Manus task—no programming required.

This transforms Manus from a tool you use manually into an automation engine that works in the background, handling repetitive tasks across your entire tech stack.

## Why Use Manus with Zapier?

Most automation tools can move data between apps, but they can't think, analyze, or create. Zapier + Manus combines:

* **Zapier's connectivity**: 8,000+ apps, triggers, and actions
* **Manus's intelligence**: Research, analysis, content creation, and decision-making

This enables intelligent automation that goes far beyond simple data transfer.

**Traditional Zapier workflows**: "When X happens, copy data to Y"

**Manus + Zapier workflows**: "When X happens, have Manus research, analyze, create content, and deliver results to Y"

## How It Works

### 1. Choose a Trigger

Select an event in another app that starts the workflow.

**Examples**:

* New email in Gmail
* New form submission in Google Forms
* New meeting scheduled in Calendly
* New lead in Salesforce
* New order in Shopify

### 2. Create a Manus Task

When the trigger fires, automatically create a Manus task with a specific prompt.

**Example**:

```
Trigger: New Calendly meeting scheduled
Action: Create Manus task with prompt:
"Research {{company_name}}. Find: employee count, recent news,
key decision makers, and potential pain points. Create a pre-meeting brief."

```

### 3. Manus Executes the Task

Manus receives the task, plans the approach, gathers information, and delivers results—just like it would for a manual task.

### 4. Use the Results

Manus completes the task and delivers results. You can:

* Receive a notification
* Have results sent to another app (Slack, email, Notion, etc.)
* Access the completed task in Manus

## Tips for Effective Zapier Workflows

### Use Dynamic Data from Triggers

Zapier lets you insert data from the trigger into your Manus prompt.

**Example**:

```
Trigger: New Calendly meeting with {{attendee_name}} from {{company_name}}
Prompt: Research {{company_name}}. Find: employee count, recent news,
and {{attendee_name}}'s role. Create a pre-meeting brief.

```

This makes every task personalized and relevant.

***

### Be Specific in Prompts

**✅ Good**: "Research this company. Find: employee count, recent funding, headquarters location, and key products. Return as a structured brief."

**❌ Vague**: "Research this company"

Specific prompts ensure consistent, useful results.

***

### Combine Multiple Actions

You can chain multiple actions together:

1. Trigger: New form submission
2. Action 1: Manus creates analysis
3. Action 2: Send results to Slack
4. Action 3: Save to Google Sheets

This creates complete, end-to-end automation.

***

### Use Filters for Precision

Add Zapier filters to only trigger Manus for specific conditions.

**Example**:

```
Trigger: New email in Gmail
Filter: Only if subject contains "partnership inquiry"
Action: Manus researches the sender's company

```

This prevents unnecessary tasks and saves credits.

***
