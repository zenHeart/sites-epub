# Mail Manus

> Email-based task interface for Manus AI agent

## What is Mail Manus?

Mail Manus is where you can trigger Manus tasks by forwarding emails to a unique bot address. Instead of switching between your inbox and the Manus app, you can delegate work directly from your email client and receive results back via email.

This approach integrates Manus into existing email workflows, making it particularly useful for processing incoming emails, handling email-based requests, and automating recurring email tasks without leaving your inbox.

**1. Unique Bot Address**: Each user receives a personal Manus email address (e.g., `your-name-abc123@mail.manus.ai`)

Navigate to Settings → Mail Manus and copy your unique bot email address.

### Workflow Automation

For recurring tasks like travel bookings, expense receipts, or invoice processing, you can set up **workflow emails**—dedicated Manus bot addresses that automatically handle specific types of emails.

### What are Workflow Emails?

Workflow emails are specialized Manus bot addresses designed for specific recurring tasks. Instead of using your main Mail Manus address, you create purpose-specific addresses like:

* `travel@manus.bot` - For flight, hotel, and conference bookings
* `expenses@manus.bot` - For receipts and expense tracking
* `invoices@manus.bot` - For invoice processing and logging

### How to Set Up Workflow Automation

**Step 1: Create Your Workflow Email**

In Manus Settings → Mail Manus → Workflow Emails, create a new workflow email:

```
Name: Business Travel
Address: travel@manus.bot
Default Prompt: "Build my itinerary, add check-ins to Calendar, set reminders, and buffer time for travels."
```

**Step 2: Set Up Email Filter**

<img src="https://mintcdn.com/docs-manus/C1PisAhqAuyVufRp/images/mail-manus2.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=C1PisAhqAuyVufRp&q=85&s=4cbaf80c5ed950aa68649e0ea5485954" alt="Mail Manus" width="2196" height="1044" data-path="images/mail-manus2.png" />

In your email client (Gmail/Outlook), create a filter to match specific emails:

**Example: Travel Bookings Filter (Gmail)**

```
From: noreply@trip.com, notifly@notifly.flyscoot.com
Subject: Business travel
Includes words: "booking confirmation," "flight," "hotel"
```

**Example: Expense Receipts Filter (Gmail)**

```
From: no-reply@uber.com
Subject: Uber E-Receipt
```

**Step 3: Connect Filter to Workflow Email**

Set the filter action to auto-forward matching emails to your workflow email:

```
When message matches criteria:
☑ Forward it to: travel@manus.bot
```

**Step 4: Automatic Processing**

Once set up, matching emails are automatically:

1. Forwarded to your workflow email
2. Processed by Manus using the default prompt
3. Results sent back to your inbox

### Real-World Workflow Examples

**Travel Management Workflow**

```
Workflow Email: travel@manus.bot
Filter: From airlines, hotels, conference organizers
Default Prompt: "Extract: dates, locations, confirmation numbers.
                Add to Google Calendar with 1-hour buffer before flights.
                Set reminders 24h and 2h before departure."

Result: Every booking confirmation automatically becomes calendar events
        with appropriate reminders and travel buffers.
```

**Expense Tracking Workflow**

```
Workflow Email: expenses@manus.bot
Filter: From Uber, Grab, Lyft (receipt emails)
Default Prompt: "Extract: date, amount, category, merchant.
                Log to Notion Expenses database."

Result: All ride-sharing receipts automatically logged to expense tracker.
```

**Invoice Processing Workflow**

```
Workflow Email: invoices@manus.bot
Filter: Subject contains "Invoice" + has PDF attachment
Default Prompt: "Extract: invoice number, date, amount, vendor, due date.
                Add to Accounting spreadsheet.
                Set reminder 3 days before due date."

Result: Incoming invoices automatically parsed and tracked with payment reminders.
```

**Customer Feedback Workflow**

```
Workflow Email: feedback@manus.bot
Filter: Subject contains "feedback" or "review"
Default Prompt: "Analyze sentiment (positive/negative/neutral).
                Extract key issues and suggestions.
                Post summary to Slack #customer-feedback channel."

Result: Customer feedback automatically analyzed and shared with team.
```
