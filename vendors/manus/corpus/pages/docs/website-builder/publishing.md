# Publishing

> Build and go live

With Manus, publishing your web application is a straightforward, one-step process. There are no servers to configure, no deployment pipelines to build, and no complex technical hurdles to overcome.

## The Publishing Process

1. **Finalize Your Web Application**: Ensure that you have completed all the necessary edits and tested your application in the preview window.
2. **Publish Your Web Application:** Click Publish and you will be able to access your website

3. **Manus Handles the Rest**: Manus will take care of the entire deployment process, including:
   * Provisioning the necessary cloud infrastructure.
   * Building and optimizing your application for production.
   * Deploying it to a secure, scalable hosting environment.
   * Configuring the necessary DNS settings if you are using a custom domain.

Your application will be live and accessible to your users within minutes. You can continue to make changes and update your application at any time by simply describing the modifications you want, and Manus will handle the redeployment process automatically.

## Custom Domains: Professionalize Your Brand

Give your web application a professional and memorable address by connecting your own custom domain. Manus makes it easy to publish your site to any domain or subdomain that you own.

### Connecting Your Domain

To connect your domain, you simply need to tell Manus which domain you want to use. For example:

> "Publish this site to my custom domain, [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)."

Manus will then provide you with the necessary DNS records that you will need to add to your domain registrar's settings. This typically involves adding or updating an A record or a CNAME record.

### Purchasing a Domain

Purchasing a custom domain inside Manus is now one of the fastest steps in going live. Instead of bouncing between external registrars and juggling DNS settings, you can search, buy, and secure your domain directly within the builder. Everything updates on the same page, and Manus handles the setup behind the scenes.

This means you can move from prototype to a fully branded, public site in minutes. Whether you are launching your first product or taking an existing project live, buying your domain through Manus keeps the entire process simple, consistent, and fast.

### Automatic SSL/HTTPS

Security is handled automatically. Once your domain is connected, Manus will provision and configure a free SSL/TLS certificate for your site. This ensures that all traffic to and from your application is encrypted, providing a secure experience for your users and improving your site's search engine ranking.

## Hosting Modes

When you publish a web application, you can choose between two hosting modes depending on your needs.

### Autoscale (Default)

Your application runs on Google Cloud Run. It scales from zero when there's no traffic, and scales up automatically to handle demand.

| Spec         | Detail                                                    |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU          | 1 vCPU per instance                                       |
| Memory       | 512 MB per instance                                       |
| Auto-scaling | 0 to 5 instances                                          |
| Cold starts  | Yes — instances spin up on first request after inactivity |
| Region       | US (default)                                              |
| Pricing      | Billed per active request duration. \$0 when idle.        |

Autoscale hosting is ideal for most web applications: APIs, dashboards, form-based tools, and sites with variable traffic.

### Reserved

Your application runs on a reserved instance. It stays running continuously — there are no cold starts and no request timeout.

| Spec         | Detail                                                                               |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CPU          | 1 vCPU                                                                               |
| Memory       | 512 MB                                                                               |
| Auto-scaling | No — single persistent process                                                       |
| Cold starts  | No — always warm and ready                                                           |
| Region       | US (default)                                                                         |
| Pricing      | Billed by actual CPU and memory consumption. Up to \~\$36/month at full utilization. |

Reserved hosting is designed for workloads that need a persistent process: background workers, WebSocket connections, message queues, bots, real-time data streams, or long-running jobs.

### Choosing Between Them

| Consideration                           | Autoscale                        | Reserved                                              |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| Traffic pattern                         | Sporadic or bursty               | Continuous or event-driven                            |
| Cost when idle                          | \$0                              | Low (idle process still consumes minimal resources)   |
| Persistent connections (WebSocket, SSE) | Not recommended                  | Recommended                                           |
| Background workers / queues             | Not supported                    | Supported                                             |
| Handles traffic spikes                  | Yes — auto-scales to 5 instances | Throttled — single instance may slow under heavy load |

You can switch between hosting modes at any time from the project settings.

Each account includes a complimentary monthly \$10 budget of credits shared between hosting and database cloud usage.
