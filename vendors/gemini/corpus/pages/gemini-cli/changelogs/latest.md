# Latest stable release: v0.55.1

Released: August 11, 2026

For most users, our latest stable release is the recommended release. Install
the latest stable version with:

```
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

## Highlights

- **PR Generation & Antigravity Agent:** Implemented Firestore concurrency
  dual-locking mechanisms in the database and introduced the Antigravity agent
  runner with comprehensive prompt templates.
- **Caretaker Triaging & Issue Security:** Improved the caretaker triage loop to
  post a descriptive comment prior to auto-closing issues, and sanitized issue
  titles within an untrusted context to ensure secure processing.
- **Enhanced Authentication & Security:** Enforced strict HTTPS validation for
  GoogleCredentialsAuthProvider to block cleartext leakage, and implemented tag
  length validation for the file keychain system.
- **Model Fallback & History Filtering:** Resolved stateful API errors by
  rotating session IDs on model fallback, optimized conversation history
  retrieval by filtering out thought parts when context management is disabled,
  and correctly skipped merged function responses when tracking active loops.
