# Agent Permissions

Antigravity uses a robust, unified permission engine to secure your environment while enabling autonomous workflows. Every sensitive operation the Agent performs is represented as a **permission resource** formatted as `action(target)`.

Permissions are evaluated across three distinct access lists:

*   **Deny**: The action is blocked immediately.
*   **Ask**: The Agent pauses and prompts for your explicit approval before proceeding.
*   **Allow**: The action is auto-approved without prompting.

Note

**Precedence Rule:** Conflicting rules are strictly evaluated in priority order: **Deny > Ask > Allow**. For example, if you configure `command(*)` in Ask and `command(git)` in Allow, the Ask rule takes precedence and prompts before every command.

## Supported Actions & Matching Rules

| Action | Target Format | Matching Behavior | Default Fallback |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `read_file` | `read_file(/path)`, `read_file(dir)`, or `read_file(*)` | Matches absolute paths or paths relative to project workspace roots. Grants recursive read access to all contained files/folders. Using `read_file(*)` matches all files on the system. | **Ask** (Auto-allowed in workspace) |
| `write_file` | `write_file(/path)` or `write_file(*)` | Same as `read_file`. Implicitly grants `read_file` for the exact same target path. | **Ask** (Auto-allowed in workspace) |
| `read_url` | `read_url(domain)` or `read_url(*)` | Matches hostnames and subdomains (e.g., `google.com` covers `mail.google.com`). Ignores URL path segments. Using `read_url(*)` matches any domain. | **Ask** |
| `execute_url` | `execute_url(domain)` or `execute_url(*)` | Actuating on web elements (clicking, typing) or driving interactive browser workflows on a domain. | **Ask** |
| `command` | `command(prefix)`, `command(regex)`, or `command(*)` | Matches by exact word/token prefix. Each whitespace-separated token is evaluated as an anchored regular expression (`^(?:pattern)$`). E.g., `command(npm run (build.*))` matches `npm run build` and `npm run build-prod`. | **Ask** |
| `unsandboxed` | `unsandboxed(prefix)`, `unsandboxed(regex)`, or `unsandboxed(*)` | Matches commands by exact word/token prefix. Commands matching this grant will be executed outside of container isolation (only applicable when terminal sandboxing is enabled). | **Ask** |
| `mcp` | `mcp(server/tool)`, `mcp(server/*)`, or `mcp(*)` | Matches exact MCP tools or all tools on a specified server (applies equally to local `mcpl` servers and remote connections). Using `mcp(*)` matches any tool. | **Ask** |

Note

**Global Wildcard Syntax (`*`):** Across all supported action types (e.g., `read_file(*)`, `command(*)`, `mcp(*)`), passing the global wildcard `*` matches all targets within that entire action namespace.

### Understanding read\_url vs execute\_url Across the Platform

The `read_url` permission governs outbound web connectivity across three distinct areas of Antigravity:

1.  **The `read_url` Tool:** When the Agent uses the internal `read_url_content` tool to fetch web page markdown for research, it checks your `read_url` grants.
2.  **Browser Subagent & Tool:** When driving Chrome sessions, `read_url` authorizes loading and viewing the target domain. However, interactive UI actuation (clicking buttons, typing text) is governed independently by `execute_url`.
3.  **Terminal Sandboxing:** In sandbox mode, any domain granted under `read_url` is compiled directly into the container’s outbound network allowlist (`AllowedDomains`), permitting commands like `curl` or `npm` to connect to authorized hosts.

### Cross-Platform Command & Path Matching

Antigravity ensures your permission rules work flawlessly whether you are developing on macOS, Linux, or Windows. On macOS and Linux, paths use standard forward slashes (`/`). On Windows, Antigravity automatically normalizes paths prior to rule evaluation by stripping drive letters (e.g., `C:`) and converting all backslashes (`\`) to forward slashes (`/`).

## Implicit Permission Rules

*   **Write implies Read:** Allowing `write_file` on a path automatically grants `read_file` on that path.
*   **Deny Read implies Deny Write:** Denying `read_file` on a path immediately blocks `write_file` on that path.

## Interactive Permission Prompts

When the Agent encounters an operation requiring approval (**Ask** mode), an interactive card appears in your editor. Before clicking **Allow** for file, URL, or MCP permissions, you can directly edit the target string in the prompt card to expand the granted scope (e.g., broadening a single file request like `/project/file.txt` to the parent directory `/project`). Antigravity validates that your edited target safely covers the operation and applies the expanded grant for the remainder of the turn, preventing repeated prompts for related operations. _(Note: Scope editing is not supported for terminal commands)._

## Terminal Sandboxing (Preview)

Permission grants also apply to commands when sandbox is enabled:

*   Paths granted under `read_file` dynamically populate the sandbox’s read-only filesystem allowlist.
*   Paths granted under `write_file` dynamically populate the sandbox’s read-write filesystem allowlist.
*   Domains granted under `read_url` define outbound network access policies.

Note

**Sandbox Availability:** Terminal sandboxing is currently in preview on macOS / Linux, and coming soon to Windows.

## Default System Behaviors & Guardrails

When an action is not explicitly listed in your Allow, Deny, or Ask lists, Antigravity falls back to secure system defaults:

1.  **Web Browsing Defaults to Ask:** Actions for `read_url` and `execute_url` default to **Ask**. Before the Agent navigates to or actuates on any web page, it will pause and prompt for your explicit approval unless an allow rule is configured.
2.  **Workspaces are Auto-Allowed:** In standard operation, reading and writing files inside your active project directory is automatically allowed. All other unconfigured actions (`command`, `mcp`, `execute_url`, non-workspace files) default to **Ask**.

## Configuration Examples

**Allow list** — actions that run without prompting:

```
command(git)                       # Standard git commands
command(npm run (build|lint|test)) # Allow safe npm scripts via regex
unsandboxed(git push)              # Allow git push outside sandbox
read_file(/var/log/app)            # Read external log paths
write_file(src/)                   # Edit relative src/ folder
read_url(google.com)               # Fetch Google subdomains
mcp(linter/*)                      # Run linter MCP tools
```

**Deny list** — actions that are permanently blocked:

```
command(rm -rf)                    # Block destructive deletions
command(curl .*)                   # Block unvetted curl downloads
command(sudo)                      # Block sudo privileges
write_file(.git/)                  # Safeguard Git history
write_file(/home/user/.ssh)        # Safeguard SSH keys
```

**Ask list** — actions that pause for manual confirmation:

```
command(*)                         # Prompt all commands
execute_url(aws.amazon.com)        # Prompt AWS console actuation
mcp(sql/execute_mutation)          # Prompt modifying SQL queries
```
