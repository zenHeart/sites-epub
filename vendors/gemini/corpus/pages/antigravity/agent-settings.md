# Agent Settings

### Terminal Command Auto Execution

Controls how the agent executes generated shell commands:

*   **Request Review**: The agent will never auto-execute terminal commands (except those explicitly added to your configurable Allow list).
*   **Always Proceed**: The agent will execute commands automatically without prompting (except those explicitly added to your configurable Deny list).

### Agent Non-Workspace File Access

Allows the agent to view and edit files outside of the active project folders.

*   By default, the agent only has access to the folders inside your Project and the application’s local app data directory `~/.gemini/antigravity/` (which contains Artifacts, Knowledge Items, etc.).
*   Enforcing this boundary protects your local sensitive data. Enable non-workspace access with caution.
