# Rules

Rules are persistent instructions, coding standards, and architectural constraints that shape how Antigravity behaves in your codebase. Unlike chat prompts that apply to a single conversation, Antigravity automatically discovers rules from your filesystem and injects them into the agent’s context.

Tip

**Rule vs. Skill**: Write a **rule** for _constraints and invariants_ (for example, “Always use `zod` for validation” or “Never import `internal/` across packages”). Write a **[skill](/docs/skills)** for _multi-step workflows_ (for example, “How to run database migrations”).

## Where rules are stored

Antigravity discovers rules across multiple scopes, listed below in order of precedence (highest to lowest). Rules are **cumulative** rather than replacement-based: Antigravity combines all discovered rules across global, workspace, and directory scopes into the prompt. When instructions conflict, more specific directory rules take priority.

### Directory-scoped rules

You can place an `AGENTS.md` or `GEMINI.md` file—or a `.agents/rules/` directory—in **any subdirectory** of your project. Whenever Antigravity reads or edits a file, it walks up the directory tree from that file’s folder to the workspace root, loading rules at each level:

*   `<dir>/AGENTS.md` or `<dir>/GEMINI.md`
*   `<dir>/.agents/AGENTS.md` or `<dir>/.agents/GEMINI.md`
*   `<dir>/.agents/rules/*.md` _(and legacy `<dir>/.agent/rules/*.md`)_

### Global rules

Global rules apply across **all** projects on your workstation:

*   **Standalone global files** (no frontmatter needed, always active): `~/.gemini/AGENTS.md`, `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`, `~/.gemini/config/AGENTS.md`, or `~/.gemini/config/GEMINI.md`
*   **Modular global rules** (YAML frontmatter required): `~/.gemini/config/rules/*.md`

Caution

**Flat directory scanning**: Antigravity scans only immediate `.md` children inside `.agents/rules/` (such as `.agents/rules/typescript.md`). Antigravity ignores files nested in subdirectories (such as `.agents/rules/frontend/react.md`) unless you explicitly register them in `.agents/rules.json`.

## YAML frontmatter and activation modes

Frontmatter requirements depend on the file type:

1.  **`AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md` do not use frontmatter.** Antigravity treats its entire content as plain Markdown and keeps it continuously active (`always_on`) for its directory scope.
2.  **Every `.md` file inside `rules/` must start with YAML frontmatter** declaring a valid `trigger`.

Caution

**Missing frontmatter or invalid `trigger`**: If a file in `.agents/rules/*.md` omits frontmatter or specifies an unrecognized `trigger` value (such as camelCase `alwaysOn` or `modelDecision`), Antigravity silently discards the rule.

### Supported frontmatter keys

Rules in `.agents/rules/` support the following YAML frontmatter keys:

```
---
trigger: model_decision       # Required: always_on | model_decision | glob | manual
description: "..."            # Required for model_decision; recommended for all rules
globs: "*.ts, *.tsx"          # Required for glob (singular `glob:` is also accepted)
---
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `trigger` | `string` | **Yes** | Controls how and when the rule activates: `model_decision`, `always_on`, `glob`, or `manual`. |
| `description` | `string` | **Required** for `model_decision` | Concise summary of when the rule applies. Antigravity injects this summary into the prompt index for `model_decision` rules, and uses it as fallback context if an `always_on` rule exceeds the token budget. |
| `globs` _(or `glob`)_ | `string` | **Required** for `glob` | Comma-separated file glob patterns (for example, `"*.py, *_test.py"`). Wrap patterns starting with `*` in quotes so YAML does not treat `*` as an alias anchor. |

### Activation modes

Configure the `trigger` key to control how and when a rule is loaded into context:

*   **`model_decision`** _(best for detailed domain guides)_: Antigravity injects only the rule’s path and `description` upfront (progressive disclosure). The agent reads the full rule on demand when your task matches the description.
    
    ```
    ---
    trigger: model_decision
    description: "Apply these guidelines whenever writing or reviewing database migrations or SQL schema changes."
    ---
    
    # Database Migration Rules
    
    1. Never drop or rename a column in a single deployment; use an expand-and-contract migration.
    2. Always add `CONCURRENTLY` when creating indexes on existing tables in PostgreSQL.
    ```
    
*   **`always_on`** _(always active in scope)_: Antigravity injects the full content into the system prompt on every turn. Prefer placing `always_on` rules directly in `AGENTS.md` when you do not need frontmatter.
    
*   **`glob`** _(file-pattern scoped)_: Automatically activates when the agent interacts with files matching any comma-separated pattern in `globs`:
    
    ```
    ---
    trigger: glob
    globs: "*.proto, **/*.pb.go"
    description: "Protobuf schema design and backward-compatibility rules."
    ---
    
    # Protobuf Conventions
    
    * Never reuse a deleted field number; always mark both the field number and name as `reserved`.
    ```
    
*   **`manual`** _(explicit `@` mention only)_: Antigravity never loads these rules automatically. The agent injects the rule only when you explicitly `@`\-mention it in chat (ideal for release checklists or audit rubrics).
    

## Advanced features and limits

### File includes

Inside any rule file (`AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, or `.agents/rules/*.md`), Antigravity supports two distinct `@` syntaxes for referencing files:

*   **`@[label](path)`**: Inlines the target file’s contents directly into the rule before prompt evaluation and size-limit checks.
    *   **Path resolution**: Antigravity resolves relative paths from the directory containing the rule file. Paths starting with `~/` expand to your user home directory.
    *   **Frontmatter stripping**: If an included file contains YAML frontmatter, Antigravity strips the frontmatter and splices in only the Markdown body.
*   **`@filename`**: Does **not** inline file contents. Instead, it resolves the path (relative to the rule file, or as a workspace-relative/absolute path) and rewrites it to a canonical absolute workspace path (`@/workspace/path`) so the agent has an unambiguous file reference.

### Sharing rules across projects

To share rules stored outside `.agents/rules/` or to include nested subdirectories of rules while preserving their YAML frontmatter and triggers, create `.agents/rules.json`:

```
{
  "inherits": [
    { "path": "../shared-config/.agents/rules.json" }
  ],
  "entries": [
    { "path": "../shared-rules", "exclude": ["deprecated_rules.md", "legacy/"] },
    { "path": "rules", "include_only": ["frontend/react.md"] }
  ]
}
```

### Size limits and token budgets

To prevent rules from exhausting the context window, Antigravity enforces two limits:

1.  **24 KB (`24,000` bytes) per-file limit**: Antigravity truncates any single rule file that exceeds 24,000 bytes (after expanding `@[label](path)` includes).
2.  **20,000-token aggregate rules budget**: All active global and `always_on` rules share a 20,000-token budget separate from the customization budget (plugins such as skills and MCP). If the total exceeds 20,000 tokens, Antigravity automatically demotes the largest rule files from inline text to lightweight pointers (`- <path>: <description>`), allowing the agent to read them on demand.
