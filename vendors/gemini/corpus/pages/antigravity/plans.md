# Plans

Google Antigravity is available with [terms](https://antigravity.google/terms) to individual accounts derived from Google’s terms of service, and available to teams under Google Cloud terms through the Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform. To learn more, see [Enterprise Get Started](/docs/enterprise).

Rate limits and model availability differs based on usage of [Google AI](https://one.google.com/about/google-ai-plans/) plans. See [Models](/docs/models) for a breakdown of model availability.

## Baseline Quota

All plans receive a baseline of:

*   Use of Gemini models including Gemini 3.1 Pro, Gemini 3.8 Flash, and other offered Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform models as the core agent model
*   Unlimited Tab completions
*   Access to all product features, such as the Scheduled Tasks and the CLI

Users on Google AI Ultra receive:

*   The highest, most generous quota, refreshed every five hours
*   Highest weekly rate limits
*   Access to third-party models

Users on Google AI Pro receive:

*   High, generous quota, refreshed every five hours until weekly limit reached
*   Higher weekly rate limit

Users not on AI Pro and Ultra plans receive:

*   Meaningful quota, refreshed weekly
*   Weekly rate limit

The baseline rate limits are primarily determined to the degree we have capacity, and exist to prevent abuse. Under the hood, the rate limits are correlated with the amount of work done by the agent, which can differ from prompt to prompt. Thus, you may get many more prompts if your tasks are more straightforward and the agent can complete the work quickly, and the opposite is also true.

Usage limits for this service are subject to modification. These adjustments may be necessary to manage system capacity and maintain service stability.

## Overages

Users on Google AI Pro or Ultra plans can utilize [purchased AI credits](http://one.google.com/ai/credits) (or any one-time promotional credits) for additional overage usage above the baseline provided quota. AI credits are consumed at standard Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform consumption pricing.

Usage of credits once the baseline quota is exhausted for any particular model is controlled by the “AI Credit Overages” user setting, which can be set to the following:

*   Never: Never use AI credits automatically, wait until the baseline quota refreshes before using this model further
*   Always: Always use AI credits when the baseline quota is exhausted (will switch back automatically to using the baseline quota once the refresh hits)

Baseline quota usage across models can be viewed in the settings page.

## Other

There is currently no support for:

*   Bring-your-own-key or bring-your-own-endpoint for additional rate limits
*   Organizational tiers via contract
