# Projects

Manage projects and organize conversation sessions in the Antigravity CLI.

## Launching sessions with projects

### 1\. Default project execution

When starting the CLI without any project flags, all conversations in the session will be in the `default-cli-project`:

```
agy
```

### 2\. Opening a session in a specific project

If you want to open a session attached to a specific existing project, pass the `--project` flag with the target project ID:

```
agy --project=<project_id>
```

### 3\. Creating a new project on startup

If you want to create a brand new project and initialize your CLI session inside it, pass the `--new-project` flag:

```
agy --new-project
```

### 4\. Resuming an existing conversation

If you resume a conversation (whether on startup via `--conversation=<conv_id>` or during a session using `/resume`), the conversation’s associated project will automatically be used.

## Moving conversations between projects (`/fork`)

While interacting in an active session, you can copy and continue your current conversation to a different project using the `/fork` slash command:

```
/fork <project_id>
```

When executed, the CLI forks your current conversation and associates the newly created conversation with `<project_id>`.
