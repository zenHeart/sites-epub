# Background tasks & subagents

Delegate slow builds, multi-file code generation, and research sweeps to parallel background agents while maintaining your active programming flow.

Note

**Antigravity 2.0 & Hub Docs:** For core platform capabilities, subagent lifecycle state diagrams, inter-agent messaging, and nesting depth limits, see the [Antigravity 2.0 Subagents Documentation](/docs/subagents).

## Asynchronous execution model

To maximize developer velocity, Antigravity CLI leverages a multi-threaded asynchronous execution architecture. Instead of locking your terminal session during long-running builds, massive codebase search sweeps, or complex multi-file edits, the primary agent delegates these operations to parallel **Subagents** or background **Tasks**.

This delegation model ensures you never have to wait on high-latency AI processes. You can continue drafting code, submitting prompts, or inspecting files while multiple autonomous background threads execute validation tasks in parallel.

## Managing agents: The `/agents` panel

The active agent-hierarchy and custom agent selection menu are fully transparent and manageable through the interactive [Agent Manager Panel (`/agents`)](/docs/cli/commands/agents).

### Opening the panel

Type `/agents` in the prompt and press Enter to open the interactive **Agent Manager Panel**.

### Panel overview

The panel displays a live checklist of all active, completed, killed, or failed background agents:

*   **Identifier**: The unique target subagent ID.
*   **Role**: The specialized role of the agent (such as “Codebase Researcher” or “Database Debugger”).
*   **State**: Live status indicators (running, done, killed, or error).
*   **Step**: A real-time summary of the tool or reasoning step currently being executed.

Tip

You can also select and switch between custom agents (or fork conversations) from this panel. See the [`/agents` command reference](/docs/cli/commands/agents) for full details on custom agent discovery and panel keybindings.

## Custom Agents (Markdown Format)

In addition to built-in agents, the CLI automatically discovers custom agents defined in Markdown format (`.md`) with YAML frontmatter:

*   **Workspace Agents**: `.agents/agents/<name>.md` or `.agents/agents/<name>/agent.md`
*   **Global Agents**: `~/.gemini/config/agents/`

When a custom agent has `subagent: true` set in its YAML frontmatter, the primary agent can invoke it via `invoke_subagent`. You can also select custom agents directly as your primary agent in the `/agents` panel menu.

For the complete schema, frontmatter parameters, and code examples, see [Custom Subagents Specification](/docs/subagents#custom-subagents).

## Deep-dive monitoring

To inspect the inner reasoning, thoughts, and logs of a specific background agent:

1.  Open the `/agents` panel and highlight the target agent using ↑/↓.
2.  Press Enter to open the **Subagent Detail View**.
3.  Inspect the subagent’s entire reasoning log, including its private internal thoughts, tool calls, and execution outputs.
4.  Press Esc to exit and return to the main Agent Manager list.

## Monitoring background tasks with `/tasks`

For non-agentic background operations, such as direct shell commands, testing suites, or simple background queries initiated via `/btw`, use the `/tasks` command.

```
/tasks
```

The tasks tracking list lets you:

*   Track standard non-interactive background processes.
*   Select a task using ↑/↓ and press Enter to view stdout logs.
*   Terminate runaway terminal processes safely.

## Keyboard ergonomics

To reduce context-switching friction when subagents require manual interaction or tool authorizations, Antigravity CLI integrates high-efficiency shortcut paths.

### Detailed “Teleport” navigation (`Alt+J`)

When a subagent encounters a tool requiring approval (e.g. writing a file or running a database migration), a status bar notification blinks.

*   Press Alt + J inside the main prompt panel to instantly “teleport” from your current conversation directly into the Detail View of the next subagent awaiting your approval.
*   Confirm or reject the action, and press Esc to teleport back to your primary thread.

### ”Fast-Path” confirmations (`Ctrl+K`)

To authorize an agent action instantly without leaving your active workspace:

1.  Look at the inline status notification displayed right above your active prompt box. It summarizes the pending action (e.g., `Subagent 12 asks to run "npm test"`).
2.  Press Ctrl + K to instantly approve the pending fast-path action without switching panels or opening overlays.
