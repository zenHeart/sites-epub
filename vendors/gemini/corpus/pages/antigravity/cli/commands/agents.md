# Agents Command (/agents)

Browse, select, and switch between custom agents, or monitor active and completed background subagents directly inside an interactive TUI panel.

## Before you begin

*   [Install Antigravity CLI](/docs/cli/install)
*   Understand the [Asynchronous execution model](/docs/cli/subagents)

## Overview

The `/agents` command opens the interactive **Agent Manager Panel**. This interface serves two distinct purposes:

1.  **Custom Agent Selection & Discovery**: Choose between the default agent and custom workflow-specific agents, or discover where to define new agents locally and globally.
2.  **Subagent Monitoring & Control**: Track, inspect, or terminate background subagents running concurrently during your active session.

Note

**Subagent Specification:** For complete details on subagent lifecycle states, inter-agent communication, and custom Markdown agent specifications (`.md`), consult the [Antigravity 2.0 Subagents Documentation](/docs/subagents) and [CLI Subagents Guide](/docs/cli/subagents).

To open the panel inside the TUI, type `/agents` and press Enter:

```
/agents
```

## Custom Agent Selection & Discovery

Antigravity CLI supports loading custom agent definitions with specialized system instructions and tool permissions. The **Available Agents** section lists all agents currently available to your session.

### 1\. Switching between agents

*   **Select**: Use ↑/↓ to highlight an agent (`Default agent` or a custom agent) under **Available Agents**, then press Enter.
*   **Status Indicator**: A green circle (`●`) indicates the active or prepared agent.
*   **Apply & Exit**: Press Esc to close the panel and apply your selection.

Note

If you are currently inside an active conversation, switching custom agents automatically forks your current session (`[ Switch will fork the current conversation on exit ]`) so you do not lose context. If you start from a fresh session, the switch applies directly (`[ Switch will create a new conversation on exit ]`).

### 2\. Creating custom agents

The header of the `/agents` panel displays exact template locations for creating new custom agents:

```
Create New Agents
  Workspace: {workspace}/.agents/agents/{agent_name}/agent.md
  Global: ~/.gemini/config/agents/{agent_name}/agent.md
```

To create a custom agent that is available across all your workspaces and projects, place it under your global customization directory (`~/.gemini/config/agents/`). Create a directory matching your agent name and add an `agent.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/config/agents/code-reviewer
cat << 'EOF' > ~/.gemini/config/agents/code-reviewer/agent.md
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Rigorous code review specialist focusing on edge cases and security.
---
You are an expert code reviewer. Analyze diffs carefully and verify edge cases.
EOF
```

When you reopen `/agents`, the CLI automatically discovers `code-reviewer` and lists it under **Available Agents**. If you need an agent scoped strictly to a single project repository, place it inside that workspace’s `.agents/agents/` directory (for example, `/home/user/projects/my-app/.agents/agents/code-reviewer/agent.md`). You can also package and distribute custom agents inside [Plugins](/docs/cli/plugins).

## Subagent Monitoring & Control

When your primary agent delegates tasks (such as running tests or querying large codebases), the spawned threads appear in the `/agents` panel under **Subagents**, grouped by their triggering prompt.

### 1\. Inspecting subagent progress

*   **Group Toggling**: Press Enter on a subagent group header (`▸ Subagents (1 running, 2 done)`) to expand or collapse (`▾`) that group.
*   **Status Indicators**: Each subagent row displays a live lifecycle state:
    *   `running`: Actively executing tools or generating reasoning steps.
    *   `done`: Successfully completed its assigned background task.
    *   `error`: Encountered a terminal failure during execution.
    *   `killed`: Terminated manually by the user or parent process.
*   **Detail View**: Highlight a specific subagent row and press Enter to open the full-screen **Subagent Detail View**. This view displays the subagent’s complete internal thoughts, tool calls, and execution stdout. Press Esc to return to the list.

### 2\. Terminating active subagents

If a background subagent loops or runs longer than needed, you can kill it immediately without leaving your session:

1.  Open `/agents` and highlight the running subagent row.
2.  Press K to kill the active subagent and all its child threads.

### 3\. Inline tool approvals

If a subagent attempts a protected operation (such as modifying a file or running a shell command in a sandboxed environment), the authorization prompt displays inline in the `/agents` panel. You can press A to approve or D to deny directly from the list.

## Panel Keybindings Reference

When focused inside the `/agents` panel, the following keyboard shortcuts apply:

| Key | Action | Behavior |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| ↑ / ↓ | Navigate | Move the cursor between headers, subagents, and available agents. |
| Enter | Select / Toggle | Expand/collapse groups, open Subagent Detail View, or select a custom agent. |
| K | Kill Active Subagent | Instantly cancel (`CancelSubagent`) the highlighted running subagent. |
| Esc | Go Back | Exit the panel, return to the prompt box, and apply any prepared agent switch. |

* * *

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Why it fails | Fix |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Expecting custom agent switches to modify turn history | Switching agents forks the conversation to preserve historical integrity | Continue your workflow in the newly forked session |
| Placing agent files directly in config root | Scanner looks specifically inside `agents/` directories | Move definition to `.agents/agents/<name>/agent.md` |
| Pressing K on completed subagents | Only targets active (`running`) subagent processes | Press Enter to inspect completed logs instead |
