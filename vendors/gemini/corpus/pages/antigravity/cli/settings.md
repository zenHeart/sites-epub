# Settings, rendering & keybindings

Configure persistent preferences, customize keyboard shortcuts, toggle terminal display buffers, and manage runtime CLI parameter overrides.

## Setting up preferences

Antigravity CLI stores user preferences in a minimal, forward-compatible JSON configuration profile.

### Configuration file location

The persistent settings are saved in a plain JSON format:

```
~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json
```

The CLI leverages **sparse persistence** by writing only values to disk that differ from their system defaults. This keeps your configuration file clean, minimal, and fully forward-compatible with future updates.

### The interactive settings panel

To edit settings directly inside your active terminal session without opening raw JSON files:

1.  Type `/config` (or its alias `/settings`) inside the prompt panel and press `Enter`.
2.  The full-screen **Settings Editor Overlay** opens.
3.  Navigate between available options using `↑`/`↓`.
4.  Press `Enter` on a highlighted parameter to toggle its state or open a text insertion field.
5.  Press `Esc` to save your modifications and close the editor.

## Command-line overrides

You can temporarily override persistent preferences for individual terminal sessions using CLI command flags:

```
agy --sandbox --model="Gemini 3.5 Flash"
```

When an override flag is active, the interactive `/config` menu displays a warning indicator alongside the modified setting:

```
! Tool Permission: strict (overridden by command flag)
```

You can still edit the persistent value on disk during these sessions, but the CLI enforces the active runtime flag override until you close the session.

## Visual rendering modes

The TUI operates in one of two visual rendering modes depending on your terminal capability and connection latency.

### Alt-screen mode (`always`)

This mode opens a dedicated display screen using the terminal’s alternate buffer, creating an immersive, standalone app interface.

*   **Key features**: Integrated scrollback, mouse-wheel scrolling support, custom rendered scrollbar, and clean terminal state restoration on exit.
*   **Best used for**: Standard local development sessions in advanced terminal emulators (such as iTerm2, Ghostty, or WezTerm).

### Inline mode (`never`)

This mode renders output sequentially directly within your terminal’s standard stdout pipeline.

*   **Key features**: Preserves entire session history inside your emulator’s native scrollback buffer, does not capture mouse inputs, and works seamlessly alongside standard command outputs.
*   **Best used for**: Remote SSH terminals, terminal multiplexers like `tmux` or `screen`, and low-bandwidth remote sessions.

Note

**Adaptive Rendering**: Setting Alt-Screen mode to `default` allows the TUI to automatically detect your environment. It defaults to Alt-Screen on advanced local shells and degrades to Inline mode when running over SSH or in non-interactive sessions.

## Configuration options reference

The interactive settings panel (`/config`) and `settings.json` allow you to customize the CLI’s behavior across several categories.

### Safety & permissions

Manage how the agent interacts with your system and codebase:

*   **Tool Permission (`toolPermission`)**: Controls the authorization flow for tools (such as running terminal commands).
    *   `request-review` (Default): Prompts for your approval before running write, bash, or web tools.
    *   `proceed-in-sandbox`: Automatically runs terminal commands if they are sandboxed; otherwise prompts for review.
    *   `strict`: Prompts for all non-read tools, ensuring maximum control.
    *   `always-proceed`: Runs all tools without prompting (highest risk, use with caution).
*   **Artifact Review (`artifactReviewPolicy`)**: Controls when the agent prompts you to review generated artifacts (like code files) before writing them to disk.
    *   `asks-for-review` (Default): Always prompts you to review changes.
    *   `agent-decides`: The agent decides whether to prompt based on the complexity of the change.
    *   `always-proceed`: The agent writes changes directly without prompting (maximizes autonomy, but increases risk of overwriting code without review).
*   **Sandbox Mode (`enableTerminalSandbox`)**: When enabled (`on`), restricts all agent-initiated terminal commands to a secure OS container.
*   **Non-Workspace Access (`allowNonWorkspaceAccess`)**: Controls whether the agent can read or write files outside your active project directories. Set to `off` by default for safety.

### Display & rendering

Customize the visual experience of the TUI:

*   **Rendering Mode (`altScreenMode`)**: Controls how the TUI utilizes your terminal buffer.
    *   `default`: Adaptive mode. Uses Alt-screen on advanced local terminals and degrades to inline mode over SSH.
    *   `always`: Forces Alt-screen mode, providing an immersive, page-based interface with mouse support and scrollbars.
    *   `never` (configurable via `settings.json`): Forces inline mode, rendering output sequentially and preserving history in your emulator’s scrollback.
*   **Color Scheme (`colorScheme`)**: Selects the visual theme. Options include `terminal` (inherits shell colors), `dark`, `light`, `solarized dark/light`, `tokyo night`, and colorblind-friendly variants.
*   **Animation Speed (`runningLightSpeed`)**: Adjusts the speed of the progress indicator animation (`fast`, `medium`, `slow`, or `off`).
*   **Verbosity (`verbosity`)**: Controls detail level. `high` shows full agent thoughts and tool steps; `low` shows only minimal progress indicators.

### Editor & notifications

Configure integrations with your host environment:

*   **Editor (`editor`)**: The text editor used to view artifacts or compose prompts (via `Ctrl+G`). Defaults to `auto` (respects `$EDITOR`), but can be set to `vim`, `emacs`, or others.
*   **Editor Mode (`editorMode`)**: The editing model used inside the CLI prompt itself. Defaults to `default` (flat text editing); set it to `vim` for modal editing. See [Vim Editor Mode](/docs/cli/vim-editor-mode). This is independent of the `editor` setting above, which only selects an external program.
*   **Notifications (`notifications`)**: When enabled (`on`), triggers a system desktop notification and a terminal bell chime when a long-running task completes or requires your attention.

### AI Credits & Feedback

Manage usage, tips, and telemetry:

*   **Use AI Credits (`useG1Credits`)**: _External builds only._ When enabled (`on`), allows the CLI to use your personal AI credits for model calls if your plan’s standard quota is exhausted.
*   **Enable Telemetry (`enableTelemetry`)**: Helps Google improve the tool by sending anonymous usage statistics and crash reports.
*   **Show Tips (`showTips`)**: Toggles the display of helpful usage tips while the agent is generating responses.
*   **Show Feedback Survey (`showFeedbackSurvey`)**: Enables periodic brief surveys after task completions to help improve the experience.

## Custom status lines & terminal titles

For advanced TUI environment integrations, you can toggle active metrics or deploy custom scripts to generate dynamic status bars and modify your terminal window titles:

*   **[Status Line Customization](/docs/cli/commands/statusline)**: Learn how to manage the status indicator panel and construct custom formatted status line shell scripts.
*   **[Terminal Title Customization](/docs/cli/commands/title)**: Learn how to toggle window title outputs and pipe live agent states into your window headers.

## Keybindings configuration

You can customize almost all keyboard shortcuts in the TUI by mapping keys to specific workspace commands.

### Keybindings file location

Custom maps are stored alongside your primary settings profile:

```
~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/keybindings.json
```

### Format and customization

The JSON structure maps a single TUI command action to an array of hotkey sequences:

```
{
    "cli.clear_screen": ["ctrl+l"],
    "prompt.insert_newline": ["shift+enter", "ctrl+j"],
    "edit.open_editor": ["ctrl+g"]
}
```

To completely disable a default hotkey, map its action to an empty array `[]`. If your JSON schema is malformed or invalid, the CLI falls back to system defaults for those specific actions and loads the remaining valid mappings.

Note

**Protected Keys**: Crucial navigation shortcuts like `cli.exit` (`Ctrl+D` / `Ctrl+C`) and `cli.enter` (`Enter`) are protected by the system and cannot be disabled.

### Restoring defaults

To revert all keys back to system defaults, delete the keybindings profile:

```
rm ~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/keybindings.json
```
