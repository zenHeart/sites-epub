# Permissions

Secure your local workstation, restrict absolute file paths, configure custom allow/deny/ask policies, and manage interactive approvals. You can also manage these rules interactively using the **[Permissions Command](/docs/cli/commands/permissions)**.

## Fine-grained permissions

To secure your workstation while enabling autonomous workflows, Antigravity CLI integrates a robust **Fine-Grained Permissions Engine**. Every sensitive operation the agent performs is represented as a **permission resource** formatted as `action(target)`.

Permissions are evaluated across three distinct access lists configured inside your global settings:

```
~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json
```

*   **`deny`**: The action is blocked immediately.
*   **`ask`**: The agent pauses and prompts for your explicit approval before proceeding.
*   **`allow`**: The action is auto-approved without prompting.

Note

**Precedence Rule**: Conflicting rules are strictly evaluated in priority order: **Deny > Ask > Allow**. For example, if you configure `command(*)` in your `ask` list and `command(git)` in your `allow` list, the `ask` rule takes precedence and prompts before every command.

## Supported actions & matching rules

Fine-grained permissions follow a standard schema pattern:

```
action(target)
```

The supported actions, target format specifications, and matching algorithms are:

| Action | Target Format | Matching Behavior | Default Fallback |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **`read_file`** | `read_file(/path)`, `read_file(dir)`, or `read_file(*)` | Matches absolute paths or paths relative to workspace roots. Grants recursive read access to all contained files/folders. `read_file(*)` matches all files on the system. | **Ask** (Auto-allowed in workspace) |
| **`write_file`** | `write_file(/path)` or `write_file(*)` | Same as `read_file`. Implicitly grants `read_file` for the exact same target path. | **Ask** (Auto-allowed in workspace) |
| **`read_url`** | `read_url(domain)` or `read_url(*)` | Matches hostnames and subdomains (e.g., `google.com` covers `mail.google.com`). Ignores URL path segments. `read_url(*)` matches any domain. | **Ask** |
| **`execute_url`** | `execute_url(domain)` or `execute_url(*)` | Actuating on web elements (clicking, typing) or driving interactive browser workflows on a domain. | **Ask** |
| **`command`** | `command(prefix)`, `command(regex)`, or `command(*)` | Matches commands by exact word/token prefix. Each whitespace-separated token is evaluated as an anchored regular expression (`^(?:pattern)$`).  
  
For example, `command(npm run (build|lint|test))` matches `npm run build` and `npm run test`. | **Ask** |
| **`unsandboxed`** | `unsandboxed(prefix)` or `unsandboxed(*)` | Matches commands by exact word/token prefix. Commands matching this grant will be executed outside of container isolation (only applicable when terminal sandboxing is enabled). | **Ask** |
| **`mcp`** | `mcp(server/tool)` or `mcp(*)` | Matches exact MCP tools or all tools on a specified server (applies to local `mcp` servers and remote connections). `mcp(*)` matches any tool. | **Ask** |

### Global wildcard syntax

Across all supported action types, passing the global wildcard `*` (such as `read_file(*)`, `command(*)`, `mcp(*)`) matches all targets within that entire action namespace.

### Implicit permission rules

*   **Write implies Read**: Allowing `write_file` on a path automatically grants `read_file` on that path.
*   **Deny Read implies Deny Write**: Denying `read_file` on a path immediately blocks `write_file` on that path.

### Cross-platform path normalization

Antigravity ensures your permission rules work flawlessly whether you are developing on macOS, Linux, or Windows. On macOS and Linux, paths use standard forward slashes (`/`). On Windows, Antigravity automatically normalizes paths prior to rule evaluation by stripping drive letters (e.g., `C:`) and converting all backslashes (`\`) to forward slashes (`/`).

## Default system behaviors & guardrails

When an action is not explicitly listed in your `allow`, `deny`, or `ask` lists, the system falls back to secure system defaults:

1.  **Workspaces are Auto-Allowed**: In standard operation, reading and writing files inside your active project directory is automatically allowed.
2.  **Web Browsing Defaults to Ask**: Actions for `read_url` and `execute_url` default to **Ask**. Before the agent navigates to or actuates on any web page, it will pause and prompt for your approval unless an allow rule is configured.
3.  **Unconfigured Actions Default to Ask**: All other unconfigured actions (`command`, `mcp`, `execute_url`, non-workspace files) default to **Ask**.

* * *

## Interactive permission prompts

When the agent encounters an operation requiring approval (**Ask** mode), an interactive prompt card appears in your TUI.

Before confirming **Allow** for file, URL, or MCP permissions, you can directly edit the target string in the prompt card to expand the granted scope (e.g., broadening a single file request like `/project/file.txt` to the parent directory `/project`). The CLI validates that your edited target safely covers the operation and applies the expanded grant for the remainder of the turn, preventing repeated prompts for related operations. _(Note: Scope editing is not supported for terminal commands)._

## Configuration examples

Add these rules to your `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` file:

```
{
    "permissions": {
        "allow": [
            "command(git)",
            "command(npm run (build|lint|test))",
            "unsandboxed(git push)",
            "read_file(/var/log/app)",
            "write_file(src/)",
            "read_url(google.com)",
            "mcp(linter/*)"
        ],
        "deny": [
            "command(rm -rf)",
            "command(curl .*)",
            "command(sudo)",
            "write_file(.git/)",
            "write_file(/home/user/.ssh)"
        ],
        "ask": ["command(*)", "execute_url(aws.amazon.com)", "mcp(sql/execute_mutation)"]
    }
}
```
