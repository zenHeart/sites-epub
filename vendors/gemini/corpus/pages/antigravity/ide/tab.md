# Antigravity IDE: Tab & Navigation

This guide covers the core navigation and completion tools: **Supercomplete**, **Tab-to-Jump**, and **Tab-to-Import**.

## Supercomplete

Supercomplete provides code suggestions in a region near your current cursor position.

### How it Works

*   **File-Wide Suggestions**: Suggestions can modify code throughout the document, handling tasks like changing variable names or updating separate function definitions simultaneously.
*   **Accepting**: Press `Tab` to accept the changes.

## Tab-to-Jump

Tab-to-Jump is a fluid navigation tool that suggests the next logical place in your document to move your cursor to.

### How it Works

*   A “Tab to jump” icon will appear offering to move your cursor to where your next logical edit will be. Pressing `Tab` instantly moves your cursor to that location.
*   **Accepting**: Press `Tab` to accept the jump.

## Tab-to-Import

Tab-to-Import handles missing dependencies without breaking your flow.

### How it Works

*   **Detection**: If you type a class or function that isn’t imported, Antigravity suggests the import.
*   **Action**: Press `Tab` to complete the word and instantly add the import statement to the top of the file.

## Settings

In your settings, you can customize the behavior of these features:

*   **Enable/Disable Features**: You can individually turn off Autocomplete, Tab-to-Jump, Supercomplete, or Tab-to-Import.
*   **Tab Speed**: Controls the responsiveness of suggestions.
    *   `Slow`: Waits for more context before suggesting.
    *   `Default`: Offers a balanced pace.
    *   `Fast`: Provides rapid-fire suggestions.
*   **Highlight Inserted Text**: When enabled, text inserted via Tab is highlighted to track changes easily.
*   **Clipboard Context**: When enabled, Antigravity uses the contents of your clipboard to improve completion accuracy.
*   **Allow Gitignored Files**: Enables Tab features (suggestions and jumping) within files listed in your `.gitignore` file. Tab will only ignore gitignored files if git is installed.
