# Marketplace

The Marketplace lets you discover, install, and manage curated [plugins](/docs/plugins) that extend your agent with reusable [skills](/docs/skills), [MCP servers](/docs/mcp), [rules](/docs/rules), and [subagents](/docs/subagents).

Note

**Cross-surface synchronization**: Plugins installed in **Antigravity 2.0** are automatically updated and displayed in the **Antigravity CLI**’s **Installed** tab.

## Inline `/plugin` commands

In addition to the interactive panel, `/plugin` supports inline commands to `install`, `uninstall`, `enable`, `disable`, and `list` plugins directly from the prompt without opening the plugin manager UI:

*   **Install from the official marketplace or a local directory**: Run the following commands (`<marketplace-name>` supports the official marketplace, `antigravity-plugins-official`):
    
    ```
    /plugin install <plugin-name>@antigravity-plugins-official
    /plugin install <local-path>
    ```
    
    For example, running `/plugin install firebase@antigravity-plugins-official` outputs:
    
    ```
    Successfully installed plugin "firebase" from "antigravity-plugins-official".
    ```
    
*   **Manage and list plugins inline**: Run the following commands:
    
    ```
    /plugin uninstall <plugin-name>
    /plugin enable <plugin-name>
    /plugin disable <plugin-name>
    /plugin list
    ```
    

* * *

## Install from your shell (`agy plugin`)

Outside an interactive TUI session, you can install and manage plugins directly from your shell using `agy plugin`:

*   **Install from the official marketplace**: Specify `<plugin-name>@antigravity-plugins-official` (`<marketplace-name>` only supports the official marketplace, `antigravity-plugins-official`), or pass a bare `<plugin-name>`, which defaults to `<plugin-name>@antigravity-plugins-official`:
    
    ```
    agy plugin install firebase@antigravity-plugins-official
    agy plugin install firebase
    ```
    
*   **Install from a GitHub link**: Clone and stage a plugin directly from a GitHub repository URL:
    
    ```
    agy plugin install https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>
    ```
    
*   **Install from a local directory**: Stage a local plugin folder into your profile:
    
    ```
    agy plugin install </path/to/local/plugin>
    ```
    
*   **List, enable, disable, or uninstall plugins**:
    
    ```
    agy plugin list
    agy plugin enable <plugin-name>
    agy plugin disable <plugin-name>
    agy plugin uninstall <plugin-name>
    ```
