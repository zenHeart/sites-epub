# Dashboard

The dashboard lets you access billing, set up usage-based pricing, and manage your Team.

## Overview

Get a quick summary of your team's activity, usage statistics, and recent changes. The overview page provides at-a-glance insights into your workspace.

## Settings

![Team settings](/docs-static/images/account/team/settings.png)

Configure team-wide preferences and security settings. The settings page includes:

## Teams & Enterprise Settings

### Privacy Settings

Control data sharing preferences for your team. Configure whether your data can be used for training, and manage team-wide privacy enforcement.

### Usage-Based Pricing Settings

Enable usage-based pricing and set spending limits. Configure monthly team
spending limits. Control whether only admins can modify these settings.

### Cursor Router

Enable model routing for Auto, choose which optimization modes team members
can select, control routed model visibility, and set Auto as the team
default. Learn more in [Cursor Router](https://cursor.com/docs/cursor-router.md).

### Team Marketplaces

Import private marketplaces from GitHub or use the Default marketplace to
distribute shared Team MCP servers and member-published skills. Set
**Marketplace Access** for the whole team, selected Organization Groups, or
an existing SCIM directory-group configuration. On the Default marketplace,
**Allow Members to Publish** controls whether members can publish personal
skills. Teams plans can add up to 1 team marketplace. Enterprise plans can
add unlimited team marketplaces. Learn more in [Team
Marketplaces](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins.md#team-marketplaces) and [Publish a skill to your
team](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins.md#publish-a-skill-to-your-team).

### Sync Skills for Cloud Agents

Let members opt in to sync `~/.cursor/skills/` so their own Cloud Agents can
use those personal skills. Synced skills stay private to the author. Admins
can turn the team setting off under **Security & Identity**, which disables
sync for everyone. Learn more in [Use personal skills with Cloud
Agents](https://cursor.com/docs/skills.md#use-personal-skills-with-cloud-agents).

### Bedrock IAM Role

Configure AWS Bedrock IAM roles for secure cloud integration.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Set up SSO authentication for enterprise teams to streamline user access and
improve security.

### Protected Git Scopes

Lock a Git organization, group, or namespace to your Cursor organization so
only your teams can use its repositories with Cloud Agents, automations, and
Bugbot. Learn more in [Protected Git Scopes](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/model-and-integration-management.md#protected-git-scopes).

### Cursor Admin API Keys

Create and manage API keys for programmatic access to Cursor's admin features.

### Active Sessions

Monitor and manage active user sessions across your team.

### Invite Code Management

Create and manage invite codes for adding new team members.

### API Endpoints

Access Cursor's REST API endpoints for programmatic integration. All API endpoints are available on both Team and [Enterprise](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise.md) plans, except for the [AI Code Tracking API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api.md) which requires Enterprise plan.

## Enterprise-Only Settings

**Device-level enforcement:** In addition to dashboard settings, enterprises can enforce policies like allowed team IDs and allowed extensions on user devices through MDM. See [Identity and Access Management](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management.md#mdm-policies) and [Deployment Patterns](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/deployment-patterns.md#mdm-configuration) for details.

### Model Access Control

Control which AI models are available to team members from **Team Settings →
Models**. Organizations can also widen access per cohort from **Organization →
Groups → Models**. Team and group model access combine as a union
(most-permissive wins). Learn more in [Model and Integration
Management](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/model-and-integration-management.md#model-access-control).

### Enhanced Spend Limits

Set individual spending limits for each team member. Configure member-level overrides, group-based limits via directory sync, or default per-member caps.

### Auto Run Configuration

Configure automatic command execution settings. Control which commands can be executed automatically and set security
policies for code execution.

### Repository Blocklist

Prevent access to specific repositories for security or compliance reasons. Learn more in [Model and Integration Management](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/model-and-integration-management.md#git-repository-blocklist).

### MCP Configuration

Configure Model Context Protocol settings.
Manage how models access and process context from your development
environment. Learn more in [Model and Integration Management](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/model-and-integration-management.md#mcp-server-trust-management).

### Cursor Ignore Configuration

Set up ignore patterns for files and directories. Control which files and directories are excluded from AI analysis and
suggestions. Learn more in [Security Guardrails](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls.md#cursorignore).

### .cursor Directory Protection

Protect the .cursor directory from unauthorized agent access. Ensure sensitive configuration and cache files remain secure. Learn more in [Security Guardrails](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/llm-safety-and-controls.md#cursor-directory-protection).

### AI Code Tracking API

Access detailed AI-generated code analytics for your team's repositories. Retrieve per-commit AI usage metrics and granular accepted AI changes through REST API endpoints. Requires Enterprise team plan. Learn more in [AI Code Tracking API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api.md).

### Audit Log

View comprehensive, tamper-proof records of security events and administrative actions. Track authentication, team changes, permission updates, API key actions, settings modifications, and more. Filter by application. CSV export includes the application. Requires an Enterprise subscription. Learn more in [Compliance and Monitoring](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/compliance-and-monitoring.md#audit-logs).

**SCIM** (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) provisioning is also
available for [Enterprise](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise.md) plans. See our [SCIM
documentation](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim.md) for setup instructions.

## Members

Manage your team members, invite new users, and control access permissions. Set role-based permissions and monitor member activity.

## Audit Log

Track security events, administrative actions, and team changes with comprehensive audit logs. View detailed records of who did what, when, and from where. Audit logs capture authentication events, membership changes, permission updates, API key actions, settings modifications, and more. Filter by application. CSV export includes the application.

![Audit Log](/docs-static/images/account/team/audit-log.png)

**Audit Log** is available exclusively on [Enterprise](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise.md) plans and can only be viewed by admins.

## Integrations
