# Origin Grants API

Origin is in Early Beta and subject to change.

A grant binds one principal to one repository or namespace with one permission. The grants API lists the grants held directly on a resource, upserts the grant a principal holds, and deletes it, so access changes can be scripted and reviewed as code. Writes reuse the access checks behind the Codebase permissions UI and record the same `repository.access_changed` and `namespace.access_changed` audit events.

The six endpoints live in the [Grants](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/reference/grants.md) group of the Origin API reference: [List Repository Grants](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/reference/list-repository-grants.md), [Upsert Repository Grant](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/reference/upsert-repository-grant.md), [Delete Repository Grant](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/reference/delete-repository-grant.md), [List Namespace Grants](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/reference/list-namespace-grants.md), [Upsert Namespace Grant](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/reference/upsert-namespace-grant.md), and [Delete Namespace Grant](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/reference/delete-namespace-grant.md). They share the [Origin API](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin.md) base URL, [authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/reference/authentication.md), [pagination](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/reference/pagination.md), and [error model](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/reference/errors.md). This page covers the concepts behind them.

## Principals

Each grant names exactly one principal.

| Principal   | Field            | Identifies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user`      | `user.id`        | A Cursor user, by the encoded `user_…` id the organization API uses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `group`     | `group.id`       | A Cursor group, by its public `grp_…` id: either a group the owner's team owns, or a group in that team's organization, returned as `publicId` by the [Organization API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/organizations/organization-admin-api.md#organization-groups) group routes. The `g_…` `id` those routes take is a different identifier. |
| `teamGroup` | `teamGroup.kind` | One of the owning team's built-in groups: `members` (every team member) or `admins` (team admins).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

A team-group grant is the floor every member of that built-in group holds on the resource. On a namespace it is the team's namespace floor. On a repository it is the team's per-repository override, and deleting it returns the repository to the namespace floor.

Users must belong to the owner's organization. A group must be one the owner's team owns, or an active group in that team's organization; a team's own groups are grantable even when the team is not linked to an organization. The write endpoints answer a user or group that does not exist exactly like one outside the organization, so a response never confirms that a principal exists. List responses omit principals that no longer resolve to an active user, group, or the owning team.

## Permissions

Repository grants and namespace grants use different permission ladders. Both map to the presets the Codebase permissions UI offers.

| Resource   | `permission` values                                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repository | `read`, `write`, `admin`                                                            |
| Namespace  | `PERMISSION_READ`, `PERMISSION_CONTRIBUTOR`, `PERMISSION_WRITE`, `PERMISSION_ADMIN` |

`PERMISSION_READ`, `PERMISSION_CONTRIBUTOR`, and `PERMISSION_WRITE` grant that level on the namespace's internal repositories. `PERMISSION_ADMIN` administers the namespace itself.

List responses report `custom` (repository) or `PERMISSION_CUSTOM` (namespace) for a grant that holds a custom policy. The upsert endpoints reject those values with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400); custom policies are outside the grants API.

## Scopes

Four scopes cover the grants API, all of them listed in [Scopes](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/reference/scopes.md): `repository:settings:read` and `repository:settings:write` for repository grants, `namespace:settings:read` and `namespace:settings:write` for namespace grants.

App installations can hold all four, so a robot calls the grants API with an installation access token. User access tokens work too. Requesting a `:write` scope also grants the matching `:read` scope. List endpoints cost 1 point and writes cost 5 against the budget in [Rate limits](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/reference/rate-limits.md).

## Upserts and deletes

Upsert is a `POST` that creates or replaces the grant a principal holds on the resource. Each principal holds one grant per resource, so repeating a request leaves the same grant in place and a different `permission` replaces the earlier one. Delete names the principal in the request body and returns `204 No Content`.

A namespace always keeps at least one admin. An upsert or delete that would leave the owner without one returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).
