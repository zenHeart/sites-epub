                Creates an installation access token for the authenticated app.

                 Requires app signing-JWT authentication, like GetAuthenticatedApp. The
                 token is scoped to the named installation, which must belong to the
                 authenticated app.
                 Callers may attenuate the token to a subset of the installation's accepted
                 scopes and accessible repositories.

                Lists webhook deliveries for the authenticated app, newest first.

                 A delivery is one event owed to one app; its id is the `webhook-id`
                 header value the receiver sees. `delivered=false` is the recovery
                 predicate: every delivery the receiver has never acknowledged with a 2xx,
                 regardless of where retries stand.

                 Deliveries are listable for 7 days after creation, and only while the app
                 has an active installation in the delivery's namespace. App-targeted
                 lifecycle events (for example `installation.deleted`) stay visible after
                 the uninstall they describe.

                Asks Origin to send deliveries again.

                 The request means "ensure a send is in flight for each of these", not
                 "add another send". Follows BatchGetContents in returning one result per
                 unique input rather than failing the batch on a bad entry, so a single
                 expired id cannot block the rest of a recovery page.

                 Answers 202: the sends are queued, delivery itself is asynchronous. Poll
                 ListWebhookDeliveries for outcomes.

                Sends a synthetic `ping` test delivery to the authenticated app's
                 configured webhook URL and reports the receiver's response, so a
                 receiver can be verified during setup without waiting for a real event.

                 The ping is signed exactly like production deliveries (Standard Webhooks
                 headers; verify against `/v1/origin/keys`) with event type `ping` and a
                 payload identifying the app. It is sent once, synchronously, with no
                 retries, and does not appear in ListWebhookDeliveries. Requires a
                 configured webhook URL; rejected with FAILED_PRECONDITION otherwise.

                 Apps hold a bounded set of active signing keys; adding a key beyond the
                 limit is rejected with a failed-precondition error until another key is
                 revoked. A key that is already registered is rejected with an

                Asks the app that reported a check run to run it again. Origin records
                 the request on the run (`rerequested_at`, and `status` becomes
                 `rerequested` while `conclusion` and the timings keep describing the
                 superseded attempt) and notifies the owning app through the
                 `repository.check_run.rerequested` webhook event; the app answers by
                 posting a fresh run for the same head SHA and `key` — a new run, or an
                 update of this one, which clears `rerequested_at` and stores the posted
                 status.

                 The run must be `completed`, must have been declared re-requestable
                 (`is_rerequestable`), must be the current attempt for its `key`, and must
                 belong to the current head of an open pull request; otherwise the call
                 fails with FAILED_PRECONDITION. One re-request may be outstanding per
                 run: while `rerequested_at` is set, a repeat request fails with
                 ALREADY_EXISTS; once the owning app has answered, the run may be
                 re-requested again. Any principal with repository contents write may
                 re-request any re-requestable run, whichever app reported it. Returns
                 the run with `rerequested_at` set and `status` `rerequested`.

                Returns the contents of several explicit paths at a ref in one request.
                 Each requested path yields a result marking whether it was found; a found
                 path carries the same `Content` shape as `GetContents` (files as base64,
                 directories as immediate `entries`, symlinks as files). Paths are matched
                 exactly — no globs or patterns — and at most 20 may be requested; duplicates
                 are removed. A single file larger than the GetContents 1 MiB cap fails the
                 whole batch with FailedPrecondition (HTTP 400). Uses POST because the path
                 list travels in the request body.

                Creates a branch reference pointing at an existing commit.
                 `ref` names the branch as `refs/heads/<branch>` or `heads/<branch>`; only
                 branch references can be created. `sha` must be the full hex SHA of a
                 commit already present in the repository. Creating a branch that already
                 points at `sha` succeeds and returns the existing reference; a branch that
                 exists at any other commit returns 409 Conflict. A create blocked by a
                 push ruleset, or on a repository whose contents are mirrored from another
                 host, fails with FAILED_PRECONDITION.

                 unaffected, so an owning-team group falls back to its owner-level default.

                Permanently disconnects a mirrored repository from its upstream source.
                 The repository keeps its current contents and becomes a native
                 repository; syncing stops in both directions and the mirror's deploy
                 credential is deleted. A repository that never had a mirror is rejected
                 with FAILED_PRECONDITION; detaching an already-detached repository
                 succeeds without effect. Detaching is not reversible through this API.

                Forces an `outbound_to_inbound` cutover without pushing this host's
                 divergent state back to the upstream source: the source is adopted as
                 source of truth as-is, and refs that only exist on this host are
                 snapshotted and abandoned. Accepted only for a repository in `outbound`
                 status, or one stuck in a `transitioning-outbound-to-inbound` status whose
                 active job requires attention (that job is superseded); any other state,
                 including a queued or running transition job, is rejected with
                 FAILED_PRECONDITION. The caller must administer the repository on the
                 mirror's upstream source; a caller without that access is rejected with
                 PERMISSION_DENIED. Returns the job tracking the forced cutover.

                                         the repository's default: a merge commit when allowed, otherwise squash;
                                         squash when the base branch requires linear history.

                Returns whether the pull request can be merged and, when it cannot, the
                 conditions that block it. Evaluates the same conditions MergePullRequest
                 enforces: for a stacked pull request the verdict covers every pull request
                 from the stack root through this one, and each blocker names the pull
                 request it belongs to. A `mergeable` verdict means a merge of the same
                 head is expected to succeed. Supported only on repositories hosted on
                 Origin; mirrored repositories are rejected with FAILED_PRECONDITION.
                 Stacks of more than 200 pull requests in total, merged ancestors included,
                 are rejected with FAILED_PRECONDITION. To follow a pull request over time,
                 subscribe to the pull request, review, and check run webhook events and
                 re-query on each.

                Requests reviews from the given users and groups on a pull request.

                 Each entry in `users` must uniquely identify a user candidate for the
                 repository by public user id or email. Each entry in `groups`
                 must uniquely identify a group candidate by group public id, qualified
                 group slug, or group slug. An unknown or ambiguous identifier returns
                 INVALID_ARGUMENT. At least one non-empty identifier is required across
                 both lists. Requesting an already-requested reviewer again bumps the
                 request timestamp so they reappear as pending after a prior submission.

                 Returns the users and groups requested by this call.

                Removes requested reviews from the given users and groups on a pull
                 request.

                 Each entry in `users` must uniquely identify a user candidate for the
                 repository by public user id or email. Each entry in `groups`
                 must uniquely identify a group candidate by group public id, qualified
                 group slug, or group slug. An unknown or ambiguous identifier returns
                 INVALID_ARGUMENT. At least one non-empty identifier is required across
                 both lists. Removing a user or group that is not currently requested is a
                 no-op.

                Creates and submits a review on a pull request, optionally together
                 with its line-anchored comments in one atomic request.

                 The review is submitted immediately. A new `approve` or `request_changes`
                 review supersedes the caller's prior live decision review on the same pull
                 request, which is dismissed. Pull request authors cannot `approve` their
                 own pull request. Fails with FAILED_PRECONDITION while the caller has an
                 unsubmitted draft review on the pull request.

                 When `comments` is set, every comment is validated against the reviewed
                 version's diff before anything is written (the same in-diff check as
                 CreatePullRequestComment); if any comment fails, the entire request
                 fails INVALID_ARGUMENT and nothing is published. Comments become visible
                 atomically with the review: no comment or event is observable until the
                 review submits, then each comment emits its `pull_request.comment.created`
                 webhook alongside the review's own event. There is never a fallback to a
                 general discussion comment.

                Dismisses a submitted review so its verdict no longer counts toward the
                 pull request's review state. The review itself is retained and keeps
                 appearing in ListPullRequestReviews, with `dismissal` set.

                 Dismissing does not require having authored the review; write permission
                 on the repository's pull request reviews is sufficient.

                 Only `approve` and `request_changes` reviews can be dismissed, and only
                 once: a `comment` review, an unsubmitted draft review, or an
                 already-dismissed review returns FAILED_PRECONDITION, and repeating the
                 call leaves the first dismissal in place. A review that does not belong to
                 the named pull request returns NOT_FOUND.

                 The search is line-oriented: a pattern never matches across a line break,
                 and each returned entry is one line. The response is complete only when

                 returns no matches and `limit_hit` false. Uses POST because the search

                Synchronizes one ref of a mirrored repository from its upstream source.
                 Returns HTTP 200 when the sync target is satisfied, or HTTP 202 when the
                 sync is still pending. `wait=false` (the default) schedules the sync and
                 usually returns 202; it returns 200 immediately when `sha` is already
                 reachable from `ref`. `wait=true` blocks until satisfied or the wait
                 budget (~2 minutes) expires; expiry still returns 202 and the sync
                 continues in the background.

                         a commitment: the app must subscribe to the
                         `repository.check_run.rerequested` webhook event and respond to each
                         delivery by posting a fresh run for the same head SHA and `key` — either
                         a new run (new `external_id`, preserving the old attempt as history) or
                         an update of the re-requested run (same `external_id`, refreshing it in
                         place). Once a run is re-requested, it reads as pending in the commit's
                         CI state until that fresh post arrives: a required check blocks merges
                         and the pull request shows the run as awaiting its re-run, so declaring
                         re-requestability without responding strands the check. Origin does not
                         verify the subscription at post time.
                         Omitted preserves the previously stored value (new runs default to
                         false); an explicit value sets it, so a later post can withdraw the
                         declaration.

                repository.check_run.rerequested webhook payload, delivered only to the app
                 that owns the check run. Answer by posting a fresh run for the same head
                 SHA and key — a new run (new external_id) or an update of the re-requested
                 run. The stamped run reads `status: rerequested` (its conclusion and
                 timings are the superseded result) until the answering post clears
                 `rerequested_at`. Each accepted re-request emits one event, and
                 a run may be re-requested again once answered, so dedupe redeliveries on
                 the event id alone; `check_run.rerequested_at` carries the outstanding
                 stamp. The payload carries no pull request context (check runs attach to
                 `(repository, sha)`): a consumer that needs the pull request resolves it
                 from `check_run.sha` via its own head mapping, or `ListPullRequests`
                 filtered to the head branch it built.
