    title: Cursor Origin API
    description: Public third-party-facing Origin API. Each operation's `x-origin-scopes` extension lists the credential types that can call it in `tokenTypes` (`app`, `installation`, or `user`) and the scopes it requires in `scopes`; `ambient` set to true means every listed scope comes with the credential itself, so an app has nothing to request for it at installation. Each webhook payload schema's `x-origin-webhook-events` extension lists the event types that deliver that payload. `x-cursor-visibility` set to `PREVIEW` marks an operation, parameter, schema, or field that is published in preview and can change before it is generally available.

                Creates an installation access token for the authenticated app.

                 Requires app signing-JWT authentication, like GetAuthenticatedApp. The
                 token is scoped to the named installation, which must belong to the
                 authenticated app.
                 Callers may attenuate the token to a subset of the installation's accepted
                 scopes and accessible repositories. The token expires after at most 15
                 minutes and never later than the app JWT that requested it (`expires_at`);
                 mint a new one rather than caching past that.

                Creates an installation user token for the authenticated app: a token that
                 acts as one member of the installation's namespace.

                 Requires app signing-JWT authentication, like CreateInstallationAccessToken.
                 The installation must belong to the authenticated app and must have been
                 granted `namespace:user_tokens:write`, or the call fails
                 PERMISSION_DENIED. Name the user by `user_id` or
                 `user_email`; a user that is unknown, ambiguous, or not a member of the
                 namespace fails PERMISSION_DENIED without saying which.

                 Requests made with the token are limited to what both the installation and
                 the user can access. Optional `scopes` and `repository_ids` narrow that
                 further; when both are set, every scope must be allowed on every listed
                 repository for both the installation and the user, or the call fails
                 PERMISSION_DENIED. Actors recorded for actions taken with the token name
                 the user, with `performed_via` identifying the app.

                 The token expires after at most 15 minutes and never later than the app
                 JWT that requested it (`expires_at`); mint a new one rather than caching
                 past that.

                Lists webhook deliveries for the authenticated app, newest first.

                 A delivery is one event owed to one app; its id is the `webhook-id`
                 header value the receiver sees. `delivered=false` is the recovery
                 predicate: every delivery the receiver has never acknowledged with a 2xx,
                 regardless of where retries stand.

                 Deliveries are listable for 7 days after creation, and only while the app
                 has an active installation in the delivery's namespace. App-targeted
                 lifecycle events (for example `installation.deleted`) stay visible after
                 the uninstall they describe.

                Asks Origin to send deliveries again.

                 The request means "ensure a send is in flight for each of these", not
                 "add another send". Follows BatchGetContents in returning one result per
                 unique input rather than failing the batch on a bad entry, so a single
                 expired id cannot block the rest of a recovery page.

                 Answers 202: the sends are queued, delivery itself is asynchronous. Poll
                 ListWebhookDeliveries for outcomes.

                Sends a synthetic `ping` test delivery to the authenticated app's
                 configured webhook URL and reports the receiver's response, so a
                 receiver can be verified during setup without waiting for a real event.

                 The ping is signed exactly like production deliveries, with event type
                 `ping` and a payload identifying the app. Its `webhook-signature` header
                 carries a `v1ed` Ed25519 signature over the lowercase hex SHA-256 digest
                 of `{webhook-id}.{webhook-timestamp}.{body}`; verify it against
                 `/v1/origin/keys`. The header names follow Standard Webhooks, but
                 Standard Webhooks libraries do not verify this signature. It is sent
                 once, synchronously, with no retries, and does not appear in
                 ListWebhookDeliveries. Requires a configured webhook URL; rejected with
                 FAILED_PRECONDITION otherwise.

                Adds a signing key to an app.

                 Apps hold a bounded set of active signing keys; adding a key beyond the
                 limit is rejected with a failed-precondition error until another key is
                 revoked. A key that is already registered is rejected with an
                 already-exists error.

                 Candidates are the namespaces of the caller's teams, the caller's personal
                 namespace, and namespaces holding repos the caller was granted. Only those
                 on which the caller holds `namespace:repositories:read` are returned, so
                 every result is a valid `owner_slug` for `ListRepos`.

                Replaces every entry on the namespace's inbound IP allowlist with
                 `entries` in one atomic change and returns the allowlist with counts of
                 what changed. Entries match stored ones by CIDR spelling after trimming
                 surrounding whitespace: a matching entry keeps its `id` and `created_at`
                 and takes the submitted `description` and `enabled`; a new CIDR is added
                 after the existing entries, in request order; a stored entry whose CIDR
                 is not submitted is removed. Whether the list is enforced does not
                 change. Either every change applies or none does.
                 An empty `entries` without `allow_empty`, more than 1000 entries, a CIDR
                 that does not parse, a range covering an entire address space (`/0`), a
                 description over 255 characters, or a CIDR submitted twice is rejected
                 with INVALID_ARGUMENT, with one `google.rpc.BadRequest` field violation
                 per offending entry (`entries[<index>]`). While the list is enforced, a
                 result that would exclude the caller's own address is rejected with
                 INVALID_ARGUMENT; a caller the enforced list already excludes is rejected
                 with PERMISSION_DENIED. An `etag` that no longer matches, or a concurrent
                 change to the same list, fails the call with ABORTED and changes
                 nothing.

                Adds repositories to an installation's repository selection.

                 Requires a user credential with installation-management access to the
                 target namespace; app and installation credentials cannot change an
                 installation's repositories. Additive only: the listed repositories are
                 unioned with the current selection, and a request whose repositories are
                 all already granted succeeds without changing anything. Every listed
                 repository must belong to the target namespace, or the request fails and
                 nothing is granted. Fails with a failed-precondition error when the
                 installation already covers all of the namespace's repositories
                 (repo_selection_mode `all`), is suspended, or predates per-installation
                 scopes.

                 one settable field must be provided.

                 Provided settings are applied as independent groups in a fixed order:
                 default branch, automatic head-branch deletion, visibility, then merge
                 methods. When a group is rejected, groups earlier in that order have
                 already been applied and remain applied; retrying with the rejected group
                 corrected converges on the requested state.

                Upserts a check suite + check run using an installation access token with
                 `repository:checks:write`. The write is attributed to the app that owns
                 the authenticated installation. A repeated call with the same
                 `(repo, head_sha, suite.key, check.key)` updates the existing check run in
                 place rather than creating a duplicate.

                 Posts are ordered by `check_run.external_updated_at` (see
                 `CheckRunInput.external_updated_at`). A post that is ignored as stale, or
                 that repeats the stored values, still returns HTTP 200 with the stored
                 suite and run; read `outcome` to tell `ignored_stale` and `unchanged`
                 apart from `created` and `updated`.

                                         hex): a pull request version's `base_sha`. Set it when the verdict depends
                                         on the base — the same `head_sha` can be the head of pull requests into
                                         different branches, and a base-scoped run counts only toward the pull
                                         requests whose latest version has this `base_sha`. It is part of the
                                         suite and run identity, so posting the same `external_id` and `key`
                                         against another base creates a separate attempt instead of overwriting.
                                         Omit it for a base-agnostic run that applies to every pull request at
                                         `head_sha`; a later post must repeat the same value to address the same
                                         attempt.

                Atomically appends 1–25 annotations when the run's durable total would
                 remain at or below 100. This follows common Checks API annotation field
                 semantics, but uses a dedicated append-only operation and nested optional
                 location. The operation is not request-idempotent: retrying after an
                 ambiguous transport failure may append duplicates and consume capacity.

                                         100 annotations; non-idempotent retries append duplicates and consume that

                                         fields must form a coherent range.

                 the request on the run (`rerequested_at`, and `status` becomes
                 `rerequested` while `conclusion` and the timings keep describing the
                 superseded attempt) and notifies the owning app through the
                 `repository.check_run.rerequested` webhook event; the app answers by
                 posting a fresh run for the same head SHA and `key` — a new run, or an
                 update of this one, which clears `rerequested_at` and stores the posted
                 status.

                 The run must be `completed`, must have been declared re-requestable
                 (`is_rerequestable`), must be the current attempt for its `key`, and must
                 belong to the current head of an open pull request; otherwise the call
                 fails with FAILED_PRECONDITION. One re-request may be outstanding per
                 run: while `rerequested_at` is set, a repeat request fails with
                 ALREADY_EXISTS; once the owning app has answered, the run may be
                 re-requested again. Any principal with repository contents write may
                 re-request any re-requestable run, whichever app reported it. Returns
                 the run with `rerequested_at` set and `status` `rerequested`.

                Atomically upserts several check runs belonging to one suite. The request
                 accepts at most 10 runs and rejects duplicate `(external_id, key)`
                 identities. Every run is committed or the entire request is rolled back.

                 The `external_updated_at` ordering rule (see
                 `CheckRunInput.external_updated_at`) is applied to each run separately:
                 a run ignored as stale does not fail the batch, and the response carries
                 the stored run in its place. `results[].outcome` reports each run's
                 verdict in request order.

                 exactly — no globs or patterns — and at most 20 may be requested; duplicates
                 are removed. A single file larger than the GetContents 1 MiB cap fails the
                 whole batch with FailedPrecondition (HTTP 400). Uses POST because the path

                Returns a Git blob object by SHA.
                 Default response is JSON with MIME-wrapped base64 `content`. Pass
                 `Accept: application/vnd.origin.raw+json` (or `application/vnd.origin.raw`)
                 on the REST surface to receive raw blob bytes instead.
                 Blobs larger than 4 MiB (decoded) are rejected; fetch larger files by
                 cloning the repository over Git HTTPS. Empty repositories return 409
                 Conflict.

                Creates a commit on a branch from inline file changes and advances the
                 branch to it. `target_branch` must currently point at `expected_head_sha`,
                 which becomes the new commit's parent; a branch that has moved or does
                 not exist fails with FAILED_PRECONDITION, as does a write blocked by a
                 push ruleset or attempted on a repository whose contents are mirrored
                 from another host. The changes must alter the tree: an empty diff is
                 rejected with FAILED_PRECONDITION. Limits per request: 1000 file changes,
                 8 MiB per file, 32 MiB of content in total.

                Returns a single Git reference by name.
                 `ref` is typically `heads/<branch>` or `tags/<tag>` (with or without a
                 leading `refs/`), or the symbolic `HEAD`. Exact match only; use
                 ListMatchingGitRefs for prefixes. Empty repositories return 409 Conflict.

                 `pull/<number>/merge` is a pull request's merge preview: a commit that
                 merges its current head into the tip of its base branch as of the last
                 refresh. Origin refreshes it when the pull request is created, when its
                 head is pushed, when it is retargeted, and when it is reopened — before
                 the matching pull request webhook events are published, within a bounded
                 time budget; a refresh that does not finish in time leaves the previous
                 ref in place and the events still publish. It is not refreshed because
                 the base branch merely advanced, and it is deleted when the merge has
                 conflicts, so a NOT_FOUND on an open pull request means conflicts or a
                 preview not yet prepared. Reading it here is the supported way to find
                 the preview; the pull request's `merge_commit_sha` is a different commit,
                 set only once it has merged.

                 repository; syncing stops in both directions and the mirror's deploy
                 credential is deleted. A repository that never had a mirror is rejected
                 with FAILED_PRECONDITION; detaching an already-detached repository
                 succeeds without effect. Detaching is not reversible through this API.

                Updates a pull request's title, body, base branch, stack parent, and/or
                 lifecycle state.

                 Omitted fields are unchanged. Present fields are applied in order:
                 metadata, then reopen/draft/ready-for-review, then base, then stack
                 parent, then close. Close runs last so a same-request retarget can still
                 see an open change; reopen runs before base so a closed pull can be
                 retargeted; the stack parent runs after base so an explicit parent wins
                 over the one a base change derives. If a later step fails, earlier steps
                 may already have been committed.

                                        `merge` writes a merge commit, `squash` a single squash commit. A method
                                         the repository does not allow fails with FAILED_PRECONDITION. Omit to use
                                         the repository's default: a merge commit when allowed, otherwise squash;
                                         squash when the base branch requires linear history.

                Brings the pull request's test merge up to date with the current tip of
                 its base branch: the merge commit at `refs/pull/{pull_number}/merge` whose
                 first parent is the base tip and whose second parent is the head. Origin
                 updates that ref when the pull request's head changes, but not when only
                 the base branch moves, so a CI run that checks it out later can test an
                 old base. Call this when the ref's first parent is behind the base tip.

                 When the recorded test merge already uses the current base tip, returns
                 it without recomputing. Otherwise computes one merge against the current
                 tip and returns its result, or `pending` when that cannot finish within
                 the request. Call again after `pending`: each call computes at most one
                 merge, and concurrent calls for the same pull request share it.

                 Supported only on native Origin repositories. Mirrored repositories,
                 closed or merged pull requests, and requests made while Origin has the
                 refresh turned off are rejected with FAILED_PRECONDITION.

                Returns whether the pull request can be merged and, when it cannot, the
                 conditions that block it. Evaluates the same conditions MergePullRequest
                 enforces: for a stacked pull request the verdict covers every pull request
                 from the stack root through this one, and each blocker names the pull
                 request it belongs to. A `mergeable` verdict means a merge of the same
                 head is expected to succeed. Stacks of more than 200 pull requests in
                 total, merged ancestors included, are rejected with FAILED_PRECONDITION.

                Requests reviews from the given users and groups on a pull request.

                 Each entry in `users` must uniquely identify a user candidate for the
                 repository by public user id or email. Each entry in `groups`
                 must uniquely identify a group candidate by group public id, qualified
                 group slug, or group slug. An unknown or ambiguous identifier returns
                 INVALID_ARGUMENT. At least one non-empty identifier is required across
                 both lists. Requesting an already-requested reviewer again bumps the
                 request timestamp so they reappear as pending after a prior submission.

                 Returns the users and groups requested by this call.

                Creates and submits a review on a pull request, optionally together
                 with its line-anchored comments in one atomic request.

                 The review is submitted immediately. A new `approve` or `request_changes`
                 review supersedes the caller's prior live decision review on the same pull
                 request, which is dismissed. Pull request authors cannot `approve` their
                 own pull request. Fails with FAILED_PRECONDITION while the caller has an
                 unsubmitted draft review on the pull request.

                 When `comments` is set, every comment is validated against the reviewed
                 version's diff before anything is written (the same in-diff check as
                 CreatePullRequestComment); if any comment fails, the entire request
                 fails INVALID_ARGUMENT and nothing is published. Comments become visible
                 atomically with the review: no comment or event is observable until the
                 review submits, then each comment emits its `pull_request.comment.created`
                 webhook alongside the review's own event. There is never a fallback to a
                 general discussion comment.

                Dismisses a submitted review so its verdict no longer counts toward the
                 pull request's review state. The review itself is retained and keeps
                 appearing in ListPullRequestReviews, with `dismissal` set.

                 Dismissing does not require having authored the review; write permission
                 on the repository's pull request reviews is sufficient, with two
                 exceptions: a service account can dismiss only its own reviews, and
                 dismissing another reviewer's `request_changes` review also requires
                 write permission on the repository's contents, because a change request
                 can block merge.

                 Only `approve` and `request_changes` reviews can be dismissed, and only
                 once: a `comment` review, an unsubmitted draft review, or an
                 already-dismissed review returns FAILED_PRECONDITION, and repeating the
                 call leaves the first dismissal in place. A review that does not belong to
                 the named pull request returns NOT_FOUND.

                Downloads a gzip-compressed tar of the repository tree at `ref`.
                 `ref` is a commit SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic name such as `HEAD`.
                 Empty `ref` uses the repository default branch.

                 REST: the first request for a given repository and resolved commit
                 streams `application/gzip` bytes. Later requests for the same commit
                 respond 302 with a short-lived signed download URL in `Location`.
                 The archive contains a single top-level directory named
                 `{owner_slug}-{name}-{short_sha}/`, where `short_sha` is the first 7 hex
                 characters of the resolved commit — the same layout as GitHub's tarball
                 endpoint. Empty repositories return 409 Conflict.

                Downloads a gzip-compressed tar of the repository tree at `ref`.
                 `ref` is a commit SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic name such as `HEAD`.
                 Empty `ref` uses the repository default branch.

                 REST: the first request for a given repository and resolved commit
                 streams `application/gzip` bytes. Later requests for the same commit
                 respond 302 with a short-lived signed download URL in `Location`.
                 The archive contains a single top-level directory named
                 `{owner_slug}-{name}-{short_sha}/`, where `short_sha` is the first 7 hex
                 characters of the resolved commit — the same layout as GitHub's tarball
                 endpoint. Empty repositories return 409 Conflict.

                Searches the text of the files in the repository at a ref and returns the
                 lines that match, plus any requested surrounding context lines.
                 The search is line-oriented: a pattern never matches across a line break,
                 and each returned entry is one line. The response is complete only when
                 `limit_hit` is false; see `max_results`. An empty repository (no refs)
                 returns no matches and `limit_hit` false. Uses POST because the search
                 parameters travel in the request body.

                Synchronizes one ref of a mirrored repository from its upstream source.
                 Returns HTTP 200 when the sync target is satisfied, or HTTP 202 when the
                 sync is still pending. `wait=false` (the default) schedules the sync and
                 usually returns 202; it returns 200 immediately when `sha` is already
                 reachable from `ref`. `wait=true` blocks until satisfied or the wait
                 budget (~2 minutes) expires; expiry still returns 202 and the sync
                 continues in the background.
                 Repositories that do not pull from an upstream source are rejected.

                 only when its suite is the commit's current suite attempt (see

                One `CreateCheckRunAnnotations` request appended annotations to a check run
                 (`repository.check_run.annotations.created`). Annotations are append-only
                 (never edited or removed individually), so `.created` is their whole
                 lifecycle, and one request is one event. `check_run` is a reference, not a
                 snapshot: read `GetCheckRun` for the run's status, conclusion, and output.
                 `annotations` is in request order and may be shorter than
                 `annotations_count` when Origin capped the list to keep the body
                 deliverable; page the rest with `ListCheckRunAnnotations`. Like the other
                 check-run webhooks the payload carries no pull request context: resolve the
                 pull request from `sha`.

                         current deadline.
                         Must not be more than 24 hours in the future. Only a running run
                         (`in_progress` or `failing`) expires: once the deadline has passed, a
                         periodic sweep completes it with the conclusion `timed_out` (setting
                         `completed_at` if the run had none), so expiry lands some minutes after
                         the deadline rather than at it — the sweep runs about every 30 minutes by
                         default, an operational setting that may change. A `queued` run never
                         expires, a `completed` post clears the deadline, and a later post with a
                         newer `external_updated_at` still applies to a timed-out run. A run the
                         sweep timed out keeps its passed deadline, which `CheckRun.deadline_at`
                         shows as unset, until a re-request or a `completed` post clears it; if a
                         later post reopens it without a new deadline before then, it expires
                         again at the first sweep that finds it `in_progress` or `failing`.

                         a commitment: the app must subscribe to the
                         `repository.check_run.rerequested` webhook event and respond to each
                         delivery by posting a fresh run for the same head SHA and `key` — either
                         a new run (new `external_id`, preserving the old attempt as history) or
                         an update of the re-requested run (same `external_id`, refreshing it in
                         place). Once a run is re-requested, it reads as pending in the commit's
                         CI state until that fresh post arrives: a required check blocks merges
                         and the pull request shows the run as awaiting its re-run, so declaring
                         re-requestability without responding strands the check. Origin does not
                         verify the subscription at post time.
                         Omitted preserves the previously stored value (new runs default to
                         false); an explicit value sets it, so a later post can withdraw the
                         declaration.

                repository.check_run.rerequested webhook payload, delivered only to the app
                 that owns the check run. Answer by posting a fresh run for the same head
                 SHA and key — a new run (new external_id) or an update of the re-requested
                 run. The stamped run reads `status: rerequested` (its conclusion and
                 timings are the superseded result) until the answering post clears
                 `rerequested_at`. Each accepted re-request emits one event, and
                 a run may be re-requested again once answered, so dedupe redeliveries on
                 the event id alone; `check_run.rerequested_at` carries the outstanding
                 stamp. The payload carries no pull request context (check runs attach to
                 `(repository, sha)`): a consumer that needs the pull request resolves it
                 from `check_run.sha` via its own head mapping, or `ListPullRequests`
                 filtered to the head branch it built.

                A persisted check suite, as returned by `PostCheckRun`. All fields are
                 server-owned; the writable shape is `CheckSuiteInput`.

                 Each `(actor, key, external_id)` reported against a commit is one suite
                 attempt. Where the API shows a commit's current suites
                 (`ListCheckSuitesForCommit`, `ListCheckRunsForCommit`, and the pull
                 request's CI state and required checks), the current attempt per
                 `(actor, key)` is the one whose runs carry the newest
                 `external_updated_at` (a suite with no runs ranks by its `created_at`);
                 ties break by the suite's `created_at`, then its `id`, newest first.
                 Superseded attempts stay readable by id.

                         `author_emails`, a commit must match both lists. Each page scans at most

                         any recorded version at this head commit, whether current or superseded.
                         Other filters still apply: `state` defaults to `"open"`, so use

                         on each result to tell a current head from a superseded one. Malformed,
                         abbreviated, and unknown SHAs match no pull requests.

                         rather than stack order; rebuild the stack's tree from each member's
                         `stack.parent_pull_request`. Combines with `state`, whose default `"open"` excludes
                         merged members (pass `state=all` for the whole stack). A well-formed id
                         that names no stack in this repository yields an empty list; any other
                         value is rejected with INVALID_ARGUMENT.

                         (`labels=bug&labels=needs, review`). A comma is part of the name. A pull
                         request is returned only when it has every named label. Whitespace around
                         each name is trimmed and a repeated name counts once. Omit the parameter,
                         or pass only blank values, for no filter. More than 10 names, a name
                         longer than 50 characters, or a name that is not a label in this
                         repository matches no pull requests. Combines with the other filters.

                         `mergeable` means merging `pull_request` lands all of them (for a stacked
                         pull request, the whole stack below it as well). Unrecognized values must

                         to (stack root first) and then by kind. Empty when `verdict` is
                         `mergeable`. At most one blocker per pull request per kind, except
                         `required_checks` (one per state) and `rule_failure` / `ruleset_error`
                         (one per distinct message); the same kind can appear for different pull
                         requests in the stack. Every blocker's `pull_request` is one of
                         `evaluated_pull_requests`.

                         New kinds are added over time. Decode with unknown values tolerated
                         (`ignoreUnknownFields` in protobuf-es, `DiscardUnknown` in Go protojson):
                         a blocker whose `kind` postdates your client then decodes with `kind`
                         unset and `message` intact, and is still blocking. Strict decoders reject
                         the whole response instead.
