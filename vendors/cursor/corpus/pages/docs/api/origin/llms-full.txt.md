# Origin API

Origin is in Early Beta and subject to change. Review the OpenAPI specification when updating an integration.

Origin is Cursor's code forge. Its public REST API lets apps and tools work with Origin repositories, commits, checks, pull requests, and app installations.

- Origin Apps authenticate with app JWTs and installation access tokens. See [Authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#authentication).
- View the full [OpenAPI specification](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/openapi.yaml) for detailed schemas and examples.
- Agents can load the [llms.txt index](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms.txt) or the complete reference as Markdown at [llms-full.txt](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt).

## Overview

Origin apps implement an OAuth-style installation consent and GitHub App–style authentication model:

1. The app signs a short-lived EdDSA JWT with its Ed25519 private key.
2. The app exchanges that JWT and an installation ID for a short-lived installation access token (`oit_…`).
3. The installation token calls repository APIs and authenticates Git over HTTPS within the installation's approved repositories and scopes.
4. Origin sends signed webhook deliveries to the app's registered webhook URL.

### Base URL

```text
https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin
```

Endpoint paths in the [reference](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#endpoint-reference) include the full `/v1/origin` prefix.

### Protocol conventions

Requests and responses use `application/json`. JSON field names are **camelCase**. Timestamps are RFC 3339 strings. Protobuf 64-bit integers, including pull request numbers and version numbers, are encoded as JSON strings.

Responses carry fields that sit at their default value rather than dropping them, so a `false` boolean, a `0` number, an empty string, and an empty array are all present in the body. Read the value itself instead of treating a missing key as the default. Fields documented as absent or omitted are optional in the contract and stay out of the body when they are unset.

## Getting started

### Origin access

- Browse Origin at [cursor.com/codebase](https://cursor.com/codebase).
- Manage app settings at [cursor.com/codebase/settings/apps](https://cursor.com/codebase/settings/apps).
- [Generate an app signing key](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#generate-an-app-signing-key) and register only the public key.

### Origin CLI

Install the Origin CLI and sign in:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://downloads.cursor.com/origin/install.sh | sh
origin auth login
```

Clone an existing repository:

```bash
origin repo clone '{ownerSlug}/{repoName}'
# or use git directly
git clone 'https://origin.cursor.com/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}.git'
```

Apps clone using [Git HTTPS authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#git-https-authentication) with an installation access token, not a user login.

## Installation

Send a customer workspace admin to:

The workspace admin chooses the target owner, approved scopes, and either all repositories or selected repositories. The customer, not the app, controls repository access.

After approval, Origin redirects to the registered callback:

```text
https://ci.example.com/origin/callback?installation_receipt=RECEIPT_JWT
```

Verify the [installation receipt](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#installation-receipt), then store the installation ID from its `sub` claim. You need it whenever you mint an installation access token.

Installations use one of two repository-selection modes:

- `all`: the installation can access every repository owned by the selected target.
- `selected`: the installation can access only repositories selected by the workspace admin.

Both modes cover mirrored repositories as well as native Origin ones, so a mirror appears in `GET /installation/repos` and can be selected. A mirror is read-only until it becomes a stable outbound mirror: see [Mirrored repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#mirrored-repositories).

Use `GET /installation/repos` with an installation token to discover the repositories available to that installation. App JWT endpoints can list, inspect, and delete the app's installations. Deleting an installation prevents new tokens from being minted.

### Installation receipt

`installation_receipt` is a short-lived compact JWT signed by Origin. It proves the installation approval came from Origin rather than a forged redirect and carries everything the callback needs. Cursor refuses to redirect without one, so external callbacks always carry it.

JOSE header:

```json
{
  "alg": "EdDSA",
  "kid": "origin-key-id",
  "typ": "origin-installation-receipt+jwt"
}
```

Claims:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin",
  "aud": "app_01...",
  "sub": "i_01...",
  "namespace_id": "ns_01...",
  "iat": 1786465200,
  "exp": 1786465500,
  "jti": "RECEIPT_UUID",
  "installedBy": {
    "id": "user_01...",
    "email": "installer@example.com",
    "displayName": "Jane Doe"
  },
  "state": "ORIGINAL_VALUE"
}
```

- `aud` is your app ID and `sub` is the installation ID to use when minting installation access tokens.
- `namespace_id` is the stable ID of the namespace the app was installed into.
- `installedBy` identifies the user who performed this install or re-consent. It describes the current action, so on a re-consent it can differ from the durable `installedBy` on [Get App Installation](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-app-installation). It carries `displayName` when the account has a name, and never carries `handle`; read the handle from a REST response or a webhook payload instead.
- Receipts expire five minutes after issuance. `jti` is unique per receipt.
- `state` is present only when the install URL carried a non-empty `state`, and echoes that value. Match it against the anti-forgery value you generated before redirecting.

Verify the receipt before trusting the callback: resolve the signing key from the [JWKS](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#discovery-and-signing-keys) by the `kid` header, require `alg` `EdDSA` and `typ` `origin-installation-receipt+jwt`, and validate the signature, `iss`, `aud`, and `exp`. Reject the callback when verification fails.

The receipt is not an installation access token. Never send it as a Bearer credential; mint installation tokens through [Create Installation Access Token](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-installation-access-token) instead.

## Authentication

Send REST credentials with the Bearer scheme. Each endpoint's **Auth** badges list the credential types it accepts:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $ORIGIN_BEARER_TOKEN"
```

Cursor API keys are not Origin Bearer tokens. For user-authenticated requests, use the [Origin CLI](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#user-authenticated-cli-requests), which exchanges a personal user API key for the short-lived access token that Origin accepts. Do not put a Cursor API key directly in the `Authorization` header.

### Generate an app signing key

Origin Apps authenticate with an Ed25519 key pair. Generate the pair locally, then register only the public key at [cursor.com/codebase/settings/apps](https://cursor.com/codebase/settings/apps). An app can hold up to 10 active signing keys.

The private key must stay secret. Do not upload it, paste it into app settings, commit it to a repository, or share it. Store it in a secrets manager. Cursor stores only the public key.

Create a PKCS#8 private key and a PEM SPKI public key with OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm ED25519 -out origin-app-private.pem
openssl pkey -in origin-app-private.pem -pubout -out origin-app-public.pem
```

The public key file starts with `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`. Paste that PEM when you add a signing key. Use the matching private key only to [sign app JWTs](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#app-jwt).

### App JWT

Sign a short-lived JWT with the Ed25519 private key paired with one of the app's active signing keys. Generate that pair as described in [Generate an app signing key](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#generate-an-app-signing-key).

JOSE header:

```json
{
  "alg": "EdDSA",
  "kid": "app_01...",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

Claims:

```json
{
  "iss": "app_01...",
  "aud": "origin-apps",
  "iat": 1782928800,
  "exp": 1782929100
}
```

Set `iss` and `kid` to the app ID. Use a lifetime of approximately five minutes.

```text
Authorization: Bearer APP_JWT
```

Use an app JWT for app-level operations such as reading app metadata, managing installations, minting installation tokens, and recovering webhook deliveries.

### Installation access token

Call [`POST /app/installations/{installationId}/access_tokens`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-installation-access-token) with an app JWT. Installation tokens begin with `oit_`.

```text
Authorization: Bearer oit_...
```

The response includes `expiresAt`. Mint tokens just in time, refresh them before expiration, treat them like passwords, and never log them.

Removing the installation, or deleting the app, invalidates its installation tokens before `expiresAt`. The REST API and Git over HTTPS then reject the token with `401`. Do not retry with the same token; the app must be reinstalled before it can mint a working one.

An installation token cannot exceed the installation's approved scopes or repository access. You can attenuate a token to fewer `scopes` or `repositoryIds`. Empty or omitted arrays inherit the complete installation grant.

Use installation tokens for repository-scoped operations, including pull requests, check-run writes, and [Git over HTTPS](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#git-https-authentication).

### Git HTTPS authentication

Installation access tokens authenticate Git over HTTPS. The Git endpoint uses HTTP Basic authentication: the password is the installation token, and the username is `x-access-token`. Bearer credentials belong on the REST API; Git HTTPS rejects them.

Mint a token from [Create Installation Access Token](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-installation-access-token) immediately before the Git operation. Tokens expire after at most 15 minutes.

Clone, fetch, and pull require [`repository:contents:read`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#scopes). Push requires [`repository:contents:write`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#scopes). The token must include the target repository in its grant.

Pushing also requires the repository's owner to be eligible to write to Origin, the same requirement [Create Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-repo) carries. A user owner must be on a Pro, Pro Student, Pro+, Ultra, or Start plan. A team owner must have an active paid team plan, must not be on Privacy Mode (Legacy), and must not have Origin turned off by a team admin. A push to a repository whose owner is ineligible returns `403`. Clone, fetch, and pull do not carry this requirement.

Read `cloneUrl` from [Get Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-repo) or [List App Installation Repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-app-installation-repositories). Both the GitHub-shaped path (`https://origin.cursor.com/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME.git`) and the legacy `/git/` path clone.

```bash
git clone "https://x-access-token:${INSTALLATION_TOKEN}@origin.cursor.com/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME.git"
```

Embedding the token in the URL stores it in `.git/config`. After a successful clone, rewrite the remote so later commands do not reuse an expired secret:

```bash
git remote set-url origin "https://origin.cursor.com/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME.git"
```

To keep the token out of the remote URL, supply it through Git's credential helper:

```bash
git -c credential.helper="!f() { echo username=x-access-token; echo password=${INSTALLATION_TOKEN}; }; f" \
  clone "https://origin.cursor.com/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME.git"
```

The Origin CLI credential helper is for user logins. App integrations pass the installation token as shown here. Treat the token like a password, never log it, and mint a fresh one before `expiresAt` when a job still needs Git access.

On a mirrored repository, an installation token clones, fetches, and pulls, and Origin rejects `git push` with `403` until the mirror becomes a stable outbound mirror. See [Mirrored repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#mirrored-repositories).

### User-authenticated CLI requests

Use `origin api` for user-authenticated requests. For an interactive session, sign in through your browser:

```bash
origin auth login
origin api /repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls
```

For a non-interactive session, provide a personal user API key from [Cursor Dashboard → API Keys](https://cursor.com/dashboard/api):

```bash
export CURSOR_API_KEY="YOUR_PERSONAL_USER_API_KEY"
origin api /repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls
```

The CLI exchanges the personal API key for a short-lived user access token, then sends that token in the `Authorization` header. Do not send the API key itself to an Origin endpoint. App integrations should use app JWTs and installation access tokens instead.

### Discovery and signing keys

Origin publishes unauthenticated discovery metadata and its active signing keys. The same keys sign webhook deliveries and [installation receipts](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#installation-receipt).

Discovery metadata identifies the issuer and `jwks_uri`:

```bash
curl https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

```json
{
  "issuer": "https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin",
  "jwks_uri": "https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/keys",
  "response_types_supported": ["id_token"],
  "subject_types_supported": ["public"],
  "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": ["EdDSA"]
}
```

`/keys` returns active Ed25519 JWKs:

```bash
curl https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/keys
```

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "OKP",
      "crv": "Ed25519",
      "use": "sig",
      "alg": "EdDSA",
      "kid": "origin-key-id",
      "x": "PUBLIC_KEY_MATERIAL"
    }
  ]
}
```

Cache the JWKS. `/keys` sends `Cache-Control: public, max-age=600, stale-if-error=600`, so reuse a cached response for 10 minutes, then refresh; if a refresh fails, keep the last good keys for at most another 10 minutes before failing verification. Also refresh on a signature that no key verifies, which drops a retired key ID. Keys rotate weekly.

Webhook signatures do not carry a key ID, so verification should try each active Ed25519 key. Installation receipts carry the signing key's `kid` in their JOSE header, so receipt verification can resolve the key directly.

## Scopes

Request only the minimum scopes your app needs. `repository:metadata:read` and app or installation metadata access are granted automatically and should not be added separately to installation URLs.

Requesting a `:write` scope also grants the matching `:read` scope, so `repository:labels:write` covers `repository:labels:read` and you do not have to list both. The reverse does not hold: a read scope never grants writes.

The installation token can only narrow these grants. It cannot add a scope or repository the workspace admin did not approve.

Mirror-state changes sit outside this table. [Transition Repo Mirror](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/migrations#transition-repo-mirror), [Force Repo Mirror Cutover](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/migrations#force-repo-mirror-cutover), and [Detach Repo Mirror](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/migrations#detach-repo-mirror) take `repository:mirror:write` or `repository:mirror:delete`, which an app cannot request at installation: they are carried by a Cursor user credential, and the caller must also administer the repository on the mirror's upstream source.

App management sits outside it for the same reason. [Create App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-app) takes `namespace:apps:create`, [List Namespace Apps](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-namespace-apps) takes `namespace:apps:read`, [Get App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-app) takes `app:settings:read`, and [Update App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#update-app), [Add App Signing Key](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#add-app-signing-key), and [Revoke App Signing Key](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#revoke-app-signing-key) take `app:settings:write`. A publisher holds these on a Cursor user credential; an app cannot request them for itself.

The table covers the scopes an app requests at installation. To look up the scope a single operation requires, read its `x-origin-scopes` extension in the [OpenAPI specification](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/openapi.yaml). That extension covers every operation, including the `app`, `installation`, and `namespace` scopes that come with the credential itself rather than from an installation grant. An operation whose scopes all come with the credential marks its extension `ambient: true`: there is nothing to request for it, and presenting the right credential is enough.

### Mirrored repositories

An installation uses every scope it holds on a native Origin repository and on a stable outbound mirror. On a repository in any other mirror state, only two scopes apply:

- `repository:metadata:read`
- `repository:contents:read`

Every other scope returns `403` on that repository, whatever the workspace admin approved. Over the REST API, repository and contents reads, commit comparison, and [Sync Mirror](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#sync-mirror) keep working, and Origin rejects pull requests, reviews, comments, checks, rulesets, and every write. Over Git HTTPS, clone, fetch, pull, and LFS download keep working, and Origin rejects push and LFS upload.

Moving a repository out of that state is a user-credential operation rather than something an installation can do: [Transition Repo Mirror](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/migrations#transition-repo-mirror) advances the mirror direction, [Force Repo Mirror Cutover](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/migrations#force-repo-mirror-cutover) cuts over to the upstream source without pushing divergent refs back, and [Detach Repo Mirror](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/migrations#detach-repo-mirror) disconnects the mirror for good.

The `mirror` object on a repository does not tell you whether writes are allowed. A mirror partway through a transition can report `mirror.status` as `outbound` and still be read-only, so treat the `403` as authoritative rather than branching on `mirror.status`.

## Rate limits

The Origin API uses a shared per-principal point budget that resets on a rolling one-minute window. Each authenticated principal kind has its own budget:

| Principal                      | Default budget      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Installation access token      | 3,000 points/minute |
| App JWT                        | 6,000 points/minute |
| Cursor user or service account | 600 points/minute   |

Every endpoint charges a fixed cost against that budget before the handler runs. Authentication and authorization failures are not charged.

| Cost | Operations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Cursor can raise per-app minute budgets for design partners. Contact Cursor if your integration needs a higher limit.

### Response headers

Charged responses and [Get Rate Limit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-rate-limit) include:

| Header                  | Description                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | Points available in the current window for this principal |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Points left in the current window                         |
| `X-RateLimit-Used`      | Points consumed in the current window                     |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | Unix timestamp (UTC seconds) when the window resets       |
| `X-RateLimit-Resource`  | Always `core` for the shared public API budget            |

`X-RateLimit-Reset` advertises a full 60-second window from the response time. The counter's window starts at the first charged request in a burst, not on a calendar-minute boundary.

### Exceeding the limit

When a request would exceed the budget, the API returns HTTP `429` with:

- `Retry-After`: seconds to wait before retrying (`60`)
- The same `X-RateLimit-*` headers, with `X-RateLimit-Remaining` set to `0`

```json
{
  "code": 8,
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded: 3000 points per minute for this installation. Retry after 60s.",
  "details": []
}
```

Wait for `Retry-After`, or until `X-RateLimit-Reset`, before retrying. Use backoff with jitter when concurrent callers share one installation token.

### Checking remaining quota

Call [Get Rate Limit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-rate-limit) to read the current budget without consuming points. The response body mirrors the `X-RateLimit-*` headers for the shared `core` resource.

## Common conventions

### Pagination

Paginated endpoints accept:

- `pageSize`: defaults to 30 and is capped at 100.
- `pageToken`: opaque token returned by the preceding page. Do not inspect or construct it.

Responses use a resource-specific collection field and `nextPageToken`. It is empty when no next page exists. Public list responses do not include total counts. Page tokens are bound to their originating resource and filters. Restart pagination when filters change. Invalid or mismatched non-empty tokens return `400`.

### Errors

Errors use a Google RPC-style body:

```json
{
  "code": 5,
  "message": "resource not found",
  "details": []
}
```

Common HTTP statuses are `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `429`, `500`, and `503`. Some Git-database operations also return `409` for repository-state conflicts. See [Rate limits](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#rate-limits) for `429` headers and retry behavior.

Use the HTTP status and `code` to branch on errors. Treat `message` as developer-facing text.

A `404` never distinguishes a resource that does not exist from one your app cannot reach. Read it as "not available to this installation" rather than as proof the resource is absent.

`details` carries typed entries: `google.rpc.BadRequest` field violations on an invalid argument, and a `google.rpc.RequestInfo` entry on every error. Origin can add detail types at any time, so ignore entries your integration does not recognize.

Every error response carries the request ID twice: in an `X-Request-ID` response header, and as a `google.rpc.RequestInfo` entry in `details`. Origin echoes the `x-request-id` you sent, or generates one when you send none. The `RequestInfo` entry is present even when `message` is an opaque internal error, so quote the request ID when you contact Cursor about a failed call.

Unmatched paths under `/v1/origin`, and requests that use the wrong method on a known path, return this same body rather than a generic router error. The message names the method and path and never echoes the query string.

### Repository paths

Repository-scoped paths take the owner slug and repository name as `{ownerSlug}/{repoName}`. Both segments resolve case-insensitively, so any casing addresses the repository. Responses return the stored name and slug rather than the casing you sent, and Git HTTPS URLs resolve the same way. Compare repository names case-insensitively, and read the canonical casing from [Get Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-repo).

Every repository-scoped path also accepts the repository's stable ID in place of the pair: send `_` as the owner slug and the ID as the repository name, as in `GET /v1/origin/repos/_/REPO_ID`. Read the ID from the `id` field on [Get Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-repo). The sentinel `_` cannot be claimed as an owner slug, so the two forms never collide. In a Connect or JSON request, set `ownerSlug` to `_` and `name` to the ID.

The ID form survives a rename, which makes it the stable way to address a repository. It grants nothing on its own: after Origin resolves the ID to a repository, your app still needs the same scope on that repository. An ID your app cannot reach returns the same `404` body as an ID that does not exist, so a response never confirms that a repository exists. A malformed ID returns `400`. [Create Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-repo) takes an owner slug alone and rejects `_`.

### Resource references

Resource snapshots contain the resource's current fields. Container context uses compact references instead of duplicating complete resources:

- `RepositoryReference` identifies a repository.
- `PullRequestReference` identifies a pull request and nests its repository reference.
- `ThreadReference` identifies the thread containing a pull request comment.
- `OriginActor` identifies a public actor as one of `user`, `app`, or `serviceAccount`. Exactly one variant is present; read the identity from that variant.

## Current limitations

- Namespace-wide repository listing and repository creation are not part of the partner API. Discover repositories through the installation.
- Commit comparison returns summary data rather than an embedded commit list. Changed files have their own paginated endpoint, [List Comparison Files](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-comparison-files).
- Threads are addressable only for resolution. There is no endpoint that lists threads directly; read them from the comments they contain.
- Push webhooks do not include a complete commit list.
- Pull request merge supports native Origin repositories. Mirrored repositories are rejected.
- A mirrored repository is read-only for an installation until it becomes a stable outbound mirror. See [Mirrored repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#mirrored-repositories).

## Implementation checklist

- Store the Ed25519 private key in a secrets manager and rotate keys deliberately. See [Generate an app signing key](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#generate-an-app-signing-key).
- Verify the [installation receipt](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#installation-receipt) on install callbacks and read the installation ID and `state` from its claims.
- Use short-lived app JWTs and mint installation tokens just in time.
- Use installation tokens, not app JWTs, for repository-scoped APIs, check-run writes, and Git HTTPS.
- Request the minimum scopes and repository access.
- Treat page tokens as opaque and restart pagination when filters change.
- Keep check `key` values stable and readable. Use a new immutable `externalId` for each retry and increasing `externalUpdatedAt` values for updates.
- Verify webhook signatures against the raw request body before parsing.
- Deduplicate deliveries with `webhook-id` and process asynchronously after returning `2xx`.
- Ignore unknown JSON fields for forward compatibility.
- Honor `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-*` headers. Use [Get Rate Limit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-rate-limit) to monitor remaining points without consuming them.

## Endpoint reference

Download the [OpenAPI specification](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/openapi.yaml) for the complete component schemas. The document declares `https://api.cursor.com` as its server and a `bearerAuth` HTTP bearer security scheme, and each operation lists the response codes that operation can return, plus a request and response example. Every operation also carries an `x-origin-scopes` extension: `scopes` holds the scope the operation requires, and `tokenTypes` holds the credential kinds it accepts. Path parameters carry the same names the URLs use, `ownerSlug` and `repoName`. Every operation carries a unique `operationId`; where one operation answers two URL shapes, the second shape's id takes a `_2` suffix, as in `OriginService_GetRepoTarball_2`.

The JSON snippets show schema-shaped placeholder values. Response field descriptions reflect the OpenAPI schema and current platform contract.

```

### Delete App Installation

/v1/origin/app/installations/

Requires no scope (app JWT).

Deletes an installation that belongs to the authenticated app and prevents new installation tokens from being minted. Already-issued short-lived tokens may remain valid until they expire (at most 15 minutes). The response body is empty.

#### Path Parameters

`installationId` string Required

The unique identifier of the installation to delete. Bound from the URL path; the installation must belong to the authenticated app.

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/app/installations/INSTALLATION_ID' \

```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

### Create Installation Access Token

/v1/origin/app/installations//access\_tokens

Requires no scope (app JWT).

Creates an installation access token for the authenticated app.

Requires app signing-JWT authentication, like GetAuthenticatedApp. The token is scoped to the named installation, which must belong to the authenticated app. Callers may attenuate the token to a subset of the installation's accepted scopes and accessible repositories.

`repositoryIds` can name a mirrored repository. The resulting token carries the installation's scopes, and Origin still applies the mirror ceiling on each request: see [Mirrored repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#mirrored-repositories).

#### Path Parameters

`installationId` string Required

The unique identifier of the installation to scope the token to. Bound from the URL path; the installation must belong to the authenticated app.

#### Request Body

`scopes` array

Scope strings to grant the token. Values must be unique and included in the installation's accepted scopes. Empty or omitted inherits the full scope grant.

`repositoryIds` array

Repository IDs to grant the token. Values must be unique, accessible to the installation, and contain at most 50 entries. Empty or omitted inherits all accessible repositories.

#### Response Fields

`token` string

Short-lived installation credential with the oit\_ prefix.

`expiresAt` string

RFC 3339 expiration time; the token expires after at most 15 minutes and never outlives the app JWT used to mint it.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/app/installations/INSTALLATION_ID/access_tokens' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "scopes": [
    "repository:contents:read",
    "repository:pull_requests:read"
  ],
  "repositoryIds": [
    "repo_01k2ja2000e0080000000000q4"
  ]
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "token": "oit_2v8xkq4m1c7p9t3w5y0z6r4b",
  "expiresAt": "2026-08-01T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### List App Installation Repositories

/v1/origin/installation/repos

Requires no scope (installation access token).

Lists repositories accessible to the authenticated app installation.

Requires an installation access token (`oit_`) minted by CreateInstallationAccessToken.

Partners discover their repositories through this endpoint. List entries are sparse repository summaries; use [Get Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-repo) for full timestamps. [Get Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-repo) includes the output-only `cloneUrl`.

Results include mirrored repositories. A mirror is read-only until it becomes a stable outbound mirror: see [Mirrored repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#mirrored-repositories).

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Max repositories to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

### List Webhook Deliveries

/v1/origin/app/webhook/deliveries

Requires no scope (app JWT).

Lists webhook deliveries for the authenticated app, newest first.

A delivery is one event owed to one app; its id is the `webhook-id` header value the receiver sees. `delivered=false` is the recovery predicate: it selects every delivery that has never received a `2xx`, including deliveries whose retry ladder ran out during an outage.

Deliveries are listable for seven days after they are created, and only while your app has an active installation in the delivery's namespace. App-targeted lifecycle events such as `installation.deleted` stay visible after the uninstall they describe.

#### Query Parameters

`delivered` boolean

Compares against `delivered_at`. `delivered=false` is the recovery predicate: it is evaluated server-side, so it cannot miss a delivery whose retry ladder exhausted mid-outage the way a caller-supplied time window silently does.

`eventType` string

Exact event type, e.g. `pull_request.created`.

`installationId` string

Narrow to one installation (`WebhookDelivery.installation.id`).

`createdAfter` string

Bound the delivery's creation time. For browsing, not for recovery.

`createdBefore` string

`pageSize` integer

Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page.

#### Response Fields

`deliveries` array

Webhook deliveries for the authenticated app, ordered newest first. Each delivery ID is the webhook-id seen by the receiver.

`deliveries[].id` string

Stable delivery identifier and the `webhook-id` value the receiver sees; use it as the idempotency key.

`deliveries[].event` object

The event this delivery carries.

`deliveries[].event.id` string

Underlying Origin event identifier. It may also be present alongside the stable delivery ID but is not the idempotency key.

`deliveries[].event.type` string

Event slug carried by the delivery for routing.

`deliveries[].installation` object

The installation this delivery belongs to. `id` is the current active installation for the target owner; unset when none exists (possible only for app-targeted lifecycle events after an uninstall).

`deliveries[].installation.id` string

Installation identifier associated with a webhook delivery list item.

`deliveries[].installation.target` object

Owner targeted by the installation.

`deliveries[].installation.target.slug` string

URL-facing owner slug used with the owner ID to identify the repository owner.

`deliveries[].installation.target.id` string

Origin owner identifier.

`deliveries[].installation.target.type` string

Owner namespace type. Output-only. Allowed values: `team`, `user`. Omitted when unknown.

`deliveries[].createdAt` string

Delivery creation timestamp used by createdAfter and createdBefore browsing filters.

`deliveries[].deliveredAt` string

Absence corresponds to delivered=false: the receiver has never acknowledged this delivery with a 2xx response.

`deliveries[].lastAttempt` object

The most recent HTTP attempt, when one exists: its response status code, latency, transport error, trigger, and time.

`deliveries[].lastAttempt.id` string

Webhook delivery attempt identifier.

`deliveries[].lastAttempt.deliveryId` string

Stable delivery identifier associated with this attempt.

`deliveries[].lastAttempt.trigger` string

Reason this delivery attempt was sent. Allowed values: `automatic`, `manual`.

`deliveries[].lastAttempt.responseStatusCode` integer

Unset when the POST produced no HTTP response (transport error, timeout).

`deliveries[].lastAttempt.latencyMs` integer

Delivery attempt latency in milliseconds.

`deliveries[].lastAttempt.errorMessage` string

Transport error detail when there was no HTTP response; empty otherwise.

`deliveries[].lastAttempt.attemptedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for this delivery attempt.

`nextPageToken` string

Opaque cursor for the next page; empty when there are no more pages.

  ]
}
```

### Batch Redeliver Webhook Deliveries

/v1/origin/app/webhook/deliveries:batchRedeliver

Requires no scope (app JWT).

Asks Origin to send deliveries again.

The request means "ensure a send is in flight for each of these", not "add another send". It returns one result per unique input rather than failing the batch on a bad entry, so a single expired ID cannot block the rest of a recovery page. A `202` means the sends are queued; delivery itself is asynchronous, so poll [List Webhook Deliveries](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-webhook-deliveries) for outcomes.

#### Request Body

`deliveryIds` array Required

Deliveries to send again. At most 100 unique entries, matching the `pageSize` ceiling on [List Webhook Deliveries](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-webhook-deliveries). Duplicates are removed, keeping first-seen order. An empty list, or more than 100 unique entries, returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Response Fields

`results` array

Accepted asynchronous redelivery results, one per unique delivery ID, with queued, already\_in\_flight, or not\_found outcomes.

`results[].deliveryId` string

Requested stable delivery ID corresponding to this batch result.

`results[].outcome` string

Redelivery disposition: `queued` when a send was created, `already_in_flight` when a send was already running, and `not_found` otherwise. `already_in_flight` is a success, not an error. `not_found` covers unknown IDs, IDs older than the seven-day retention window, and namespaces where your app is no longer installed.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/app/webhook/deliveries:batchRedeliver' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "deliveryIds": [
    "whd_01k2ja2000e0080000000000j9"
  ]
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "deliveryId": "whd_01k2ja2000e0080000000000j9",
      "outcome": "queued"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Ping Webhook

/v1/origin/app/webhook/pings

Requires no scope (app JWT).

Sends a test delivery to the authenticated app's webhook URL and reports what the receiver answered.

Use it to verify a receiver while you set an app up, instead of waiting for a real event. Requires app signing-JWT authentication, like [Get Authenticated App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-authenticated-app).

The receiver sees the production shape: the same [headers](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#headers) and `v1ed` signature, verifiable against the [signing keys](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#discovery-and-signing-keys), with `webhook-event-type` set to `ping` and a payload naming the app. A ping belongs to no installation, so the `webhook-installation-id` header and the envelope's `installationId` are both absent.

Origin sends the ping once, synchronously, and reports the outcome in the response. There are no retries, and a ping is not a domain event: it never appears in [List Webhook Deliveries](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-webhook-deliveries) and cannot be redelivered. A receiver that fails is reported in the response rather than as an error. An app with no webhook URL configured returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

#### Request Body

The request takes no fields. Send an empty JSON object.

#### Response Fields

`deliveryId` string

The test delivery's `webhook-id`, matching the header the receiver saw.

`eventId` string

Event ID inside the signed envelope, the same value as `event.id`.

`delivered` boolean

True when the receiver answered with a `2xx` status before the delivery timeout. Always present.

`responseStatusCode` integer

HTTP status the receiver answered with, or `0` when no response arrived because the connection failed or timed out. Always present.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/app/webhook/pings' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "deliveryId": "whd_01k2ja2000e0080000000000j9",
  "eventId": "evt_01k2ja2000e0080000000000r5",
  "delivered": true,
  "responseStatusCode": 200
}
```

### Get App

/v1/origin/apps/

Requires scope `app:settings:read` (user access token).

Returns a single app by its identifier. This is the management read for app publishers; [Get Authenticated App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-authenticated-app) is the equivalent self-read for the app's own JWT credential.

#### Path Parameters

`appId` string Required

App identifier, prefixed `app_`.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Globally unique app identifier, prefixed `app_`.

`displayName` string

`namespaceSlug` string

Slug of the namespace that owns the app.

`description` string

Publisher-provided app description. Empty when unset.

`websiteUrl` string

Publisher website. Empty when unset.

`defaultScopes` array

}
```

### Update App

/v1/origin/apps/

Requires scope `app:settings:write` (user access token).

Updates an app's settings. Omitted fields are left unchanged, and at least one settable field must be provided. Clearing `webhookUrl` by sending an empty string disables outbound webhook delivery and cancels the app's pending deliveries; setting a URL again does not resurrect cancelled deliveries.

#### Path Parameters

App identifier, prefixed `app_`.

#### Request Body

`displayName` string

New human-facing app name. Must not be empty when provided.

`webhookUrl` string

New outbound webhook delivery URL, an absolute HTTPS URL. An empty string disables webhook delivery and cancels the app's pending deliveries.

`events` object

Clean replace of the webhook event subscriptions. Omit to leave them unchanged.

`events.events` array

The app's complete new set of webhook event subscriptions. An empty list clears them.

`description` string

New app description. Omit to leave it unchanged; an empty string clears it.

`websiteUrl` string

New publisher website. Omit to leave it unchanged; an empty string clears it.

`installationRedirectUris` object

### Add App Signing Key

/v1/origin/apps//signing\_keys

Requires scope `app:settings:write` (user access token).

Adds a signing key to an app. Apps hold a bounded set of active signing keys; adding a key beyond the limit returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400) until another key is revoked. A key that is already registered returns `AlreadyExists` (HTTP 409 Conflict).

#### Path Parameters

`appId` string Required

App identifier, prefixed `app_`.

#### Request Body

`publicKey` string Required

PEM SPKI Ed25519 public key to add to the app's signing key set.

#### Response Fields

`kid` string

Key ID: the base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest of the key's SPKI DER encoding. Use it as the JWT `kid` header and to revoke the key.

`createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for when the key was registered.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/apps/APP_ID/signing_keys' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "publicKey": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMCowBQYDK2VwAyEAq9zTf3hL6wXe1cVj0bYs5mKR8uDnG2oAaPp4NiEkKlM=\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"
}'

  "createdAt": "2026-08-02T14:45:00Z"
}
```

### Revoke App Signing Key

/v1/origin/apps//signing\_keys/

Requires scope `app:settings:write` (user access token).

Revokes an app signing key by its key ID. App JWTs signed with a revoked key stop authenticating. The last active signing key cannot be revoked; that request returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400). The response body is empty.

#### Path Parameters

`appId` string Required

App identifier, prefixed `app_`.

`kid` string Required

Key ID of the signing key to revoke.

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/apps/{appId}/signing_keys/{kid}' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content

### Update Repo

/v1/origin/repos//

Requires scope `repository:settings:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Updates repository settings. Omitted fields are left unchanged, and at least one settable field must be provided.

Settings apply as independent groups in a fixed order: default branch, automatic head-branch deletion, visibility, then merge methods. The update is not atomic across groups. When a group is rejected, the groups before it in that order are already applied and stay applied, so retry with the rejected group corrected to converge on the state you asked for. The response carries the repository as of the last group applied.

A request that sets no field returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). A concurrent change to the default branch returns `409 Conflict`.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`defaultBranch` string

New default branch. Must name an existing branch. Supported only on repositories that neither pull from nor push to an upstream source; other repositories return `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

`allowMergeCommit` boolean

Whether pull requests can land as merge commits. Must be sent together with `allowSquashMerge`, and at least one of the two must be `true`. Sending one without the other returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`allowSquashMerge` boolean

Whether pull requests can land as squash merges. Must be sent together with `allowMergeCommit`, and at least one of the two must be `true`. Sending one without the other returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`deleteBranchOnMerge` boolean

Whether the head branch is deleted automatically on merge. Supported only on repositories whose pull requests live on this API; a repository that pulls from an upstream source returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

`visibility` string

New repository visibility. Allowed values: `internal`, `private`. Omit it to leave the visibility unchanged.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Origin repository identifier.

`name` string

Repository name within its owner.

`fullName` string

Combined owner and repository name, such as acme/api.

`owner` object

Owner reference for the repository.

`owner.slug` string

URL-facing owner slug used with the owner ID to identify the repository owner.

### Create Repo

/v1/origin/repos/

Requires scope `namespace:repositories:create` (user access token).

Creates a repo belonging to an owner.

The owner must be eligible to write to Origin when the request is made. A user owner must be on a Pro, Pro Student, Pro+, Ultra, or Start plan. A team owner must have an active paid team plan, must not be on Privacy Mode (Legacy), and must not have Origin turned off by a team admin. An ineligible owner returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400). Reading existing repositories does not carry this requirement.

Repository names are claimed case-insensitively. A name that differs only in case from a repository the owner already has is rejected, so `widgets` and `Widgets` cannot coexist in one namespace. The name you send is stored as you send it.

The first push to a new repo can retarget its default branch. When that push only creates branches and none of them is the repo's stored default branch, Origin sets the default branch to the created branch, or to `main` or `master` when the push creates several and one of those names is among them. The default branch is otherwise unchanged. Read the current value from [Get Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-repo).

### Get Repo Tarball

/v1/origin/repos///tarball/

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Downloads a gzip-compressed tar of the repository tree at `ref`.

Origin keys the archive on the repository and the commit `ref` resolves to. The first request for a given commit responds `200` with `Content-Type: application/gzip` and streams the archive as the response body. Later requests for the same commit respond `302` with an empty body and a signed download URL in `Location`, valid for 15 minutes; follow the redirect to fetch the bytes. Archive entries sit at the root of the tar, with no wrapping directory. An empty repository returns `ABORTED` (HTTP 409 Conflict), and a ref that does not resolve returns `404`.

Send the ref as a query parameter instead of a path segment to address a ref containing "/": `GET /v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/tarball?ref=refs/heads/main`. Omit it to archive the repository's default branch.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`ref` string Required

Commit SHA (full or abbreviated hex), bare branch or tag name, fully qualified `refs/heads/...` or `refs/tags/...`, or symbolic `HEAD`. Not a glob or revspec, so `<rev>~3` is rejected. Empty uses the repository default branch.

#### Response Fields

`sha` string

Resolved commit object ID: 40- or 64-character hex. Returned to Connect and JSON callers; over REST, read it from the archive filename or the signed URL.

`downloadUrl` string

Short-lived signed download URL, valid for 15 minutes. Empty when the response streams the archive inline, which is the first request for this repository and commit. Over REST the same URL is sent as the `Location` header on the `302`.

```bash
curl --request GET --location --output repo.tar.gz \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/tarball/HEAD' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "downloadUrl": "https://artifacts.origin.cursor.com/tarballs/0192f7a4-6c1e-7b3a-9f21-3d54c9a7e6b0/9a41f0c3d2b8e7f6a5c4d3e2f1b0a9c8d7e6f5a4.tar.gz?Expires=1767225600&Signature=EXAMPLE&Key-Pair-Id=KEXAMPLE123",
  "sha": "9a41f0c3d2b8e7f6a5c4d3e2f1b0a9c8d7e6f5a4"
}
```

### Sync Mirror

/v1/origin/repos//:syncMirror

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Synchronizes one ref of a mirrored repository from its upstream source. Returns HTTP `200` when the sync target is satisfied, or HTTP `202` when the sync is still pending. `wait=false` (the default) schedules the sync and usually returns `202`; it returns `200` immediately when `sha` is already reachable from `ref`. `wait=true` blocks until satisfied or the wait budget (\~2 minutes) expires; expiry still returns `202` and the sync continues in the background. Repositories that do not pull from an upstream source are rejected.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`ref` string Required

Full git ref name to fetch. Must start with `refs/` and name a ref after that prefix, for example `refs/heads/main` or `refs/tags/v1`. Short names such as `main` are rejected with `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

`wait` boolean

When true, block until synced or the wait budget expires. Defaults to false.

`sha` string

Optional full commit object ID: 40- or 64-character hex. Omit or leave empty to wait on the tip of `ref`. When set and reachable from `ref`, the call returns early without waiting for other mirror work to drain. Other values are rejected with `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

#### Response Fields

`synced` boolean

True when the sync target is known to be satisfied, false while the sync is still pending. Always present, mirroring the HTTP status: `200` when true, `202` when false.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME:syncMirror' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "ref": "refs/heads/main",
  "wait": true
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "synced": true
}
```

## Checks

- The first run upsert creates its suite automatically.
- Required checks match the installing app plus the suite `key`, and optionally a run `key`. `name` is display-only and is not used for matching.
- Keep `key` values stable across attempts and readable for users, since required-check configuration is keyed on them.
- Reuse `externalId` to update an attempt, which discards that attempt's previous result; use a new `externalId` for a retry so the earlier attempt stays as history.
- Use `checkRun.output` for human-readable results:
  - `title`: short result headline, up to 255 characters.
  - `summary`: primary Markdown summary, up to 65,535 UTF-8 bytes.
  - `text`: extended Markdown details, up to 65,535 UTF-8 bytes.
- Use `detailsUrl` for a link to the provider's external results page.

### Post Check Run

/v1/origin/repos///check-runs

Requires scope `repository:checks:write` (installation access token).

Upserts a check suite + check run using an installation access token with `repository:checks:write`. The write is attributed to the app that owns the authenticated installation. A repeated call with the same `(repo, head_sha, suite.key, check.key)` updates the existing check run in place rather than creating a duplicate.

The endpoint atomically resolves or creates the suite attempt and upserts one run attempt. `externalUpdatedAt` orders updates to the same run identity; stale retries cannot overwrite newer state.

`deadlineAt` records an optional deadline on the run. Origin stores it, returns it on reads, and clears it once the run reaches `completed`. A deadline more than 24 hours in the future is rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) rather than clamped.

When the deadline passes on a run still `in_progress`, Origin completes the run itself with a `timed_out` conclusion and delivers `repository.check_run.completed`. Expiry runs as a periodic sweep rather than on a per-run timer, so a run can sit past its deadline briefly before Origin closes it. A `queued` run never expires, and neither does a run that carries no `deadlineAt`. Completing the run yourself before the deadline clears it. Origin leaves the run's `externalUpdatedAt` untouched when it times a run out, so a later completion from your provider can still overwrite the `timed_out` conclusion.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`headSha` string Required

Head commit SHA the check run is reported against (40- or 64-char hex).

`checkSuite` object Required

The suite the check run belongs to; upserted alongside the check run.

`checkSuite.key` string Required

Stable, app-chosen key identifying the logical suite across attempts.

`checkSuite.name` string Required

Human-facing suite name.

`checkSuite.detailsUrl` string

Optional link to more detail about the suite as a whole.

`checkSuite.externalId` string Required

Provider-assigned immutable identity for this suite attempt.

`checkRun` object Required

The check run to upsert.

`checkRun.key` string Required

Stable, app-chosen key identifying the logical check across attempts.

`checkRun.name` string Required

Human-facing check-run name.

`checkRun.status` string Required

Settable values: `CHECK_RUN_LIFECYCLE_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED`, `queued`, `in_progress`, `completed`. The schema also lists `rerequested`, which only Origin sets on re-request; a request carrying it returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`checkRun.conclusion` string

Required iff `status == completed`. Allowed values: `CHECK_RUN_CONCLUSION_UNSPECIFIED`, `success`, `failure`, `neutral`, `cancelled`, `skipped`, `timed_out`, `action_required`, `stale`.

`checkRun.externalUpdatedAt` string Required

The external system's last-update time. Used to order concurrent updates so a stale retry can't overwrite newer state.

`checkRun.startedAt` string

When the check run started.

`checkRun.completedAt` string

When the check run completed.

`checkRun.detailsUrl` string

Optional link to more detail about this specific check run (e.g. the provider's job/build URL).

`checkRun.externalId` string Required

Provider-assigned immutable identity for this check attempt.

`checkRun.output` object

Human-readable output for this check run.

`checkRun.output.title` string

Short headline for the output. Maximum length: 255 characters.

`checkRun.output.summary` string

Summary of the output. May contain Markdown. Maximum UTF-8 size: 65535 bytes.

`checkRun.output.text` string

Detailed output. May contain Markdown. Maximum UTF-8 size: 65535 bytes.

`checkRun.deadlineAt` string

Deadline for the check run, as an RFC 3339 timestamp. Values more than 24 hours in the future are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) rather than clamped. Omit it on a create to record no deadline; omit it on an update to leave the stored deadline unchanged.

`checkRun.isRerequestable` boolean

Declares that the run can be run again on request. Setting it to `true` commits your app to subscribing to [`repository.check_run.rerequested`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events) and answering each delivery by posting a fresh run for the same head SHA and `key`: either a new run under a new `externalId`, which keeps the old attempt as history, or an update of the re-requested run under the same `externalId`, which refreshes it in place. Until that fresh post arrives the re-requested run reads as pending in the commit's latest check state, so a required check blocks merging and the pull request shows the run as awaiting its re-run; declaring re-requestability without answering strands the check. Origin does not verify the subscription when you post. Omit it to keep the stored value, which is `false` on a new run; send `false` to withdraw the declaration.

Public identifier for the app.

`checkRun.actor.app.displayName` string

While it is set, `status` is `rerequested` and the run stays in the commit's latest check state and reads as pending, with `conclusion` and the timings still carrying the superseded result, so a required check blocks merging until the app answers.

`checkRun.rerequestedBy` object

Principal that asked for the re-run, carrying the same actor variants as `actor`. Present whenever `rerequestedAt` is set, and cleared together with it.

### Batch Upsert Check Runs

/v1/origin/repos///check-runs:batchUpsert

Requires scope `repository:checks:write` (installation access token).

Atomically upserts several check runs belonging to one suite. The request accepts at most 10 runs and rejects duplicate `(external_id, key)` identities. Every run is committed or the entire request is rolled back.

Each run accepts the same optional `deadlineAt` as [Post Check Run](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#post-check-run).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`headSha` string Required

Head commit SHA the check runs are reported against (40- or 64-char hex).

`checkSuite` object Required

The suite shared by every check run in this request.

`checkSuite.key` string Required

Stable, app-chosen key identifying the logical suite across attempts.

`checkSuite.name` string Required

Human-facing suite name.

`checkSuite.detailsUrl` string

Optional link to more detail about the suite as a whole.

`checkSuite.externalId` string Required

Provider-assigned immutable identity for this suite attempt.

`checkRuns` array Required

Check runs to upsert, in response order. Must contain 1-10 entries with unique `(external_id, key)` identities.

`checkRuns[0].key` string Required

Stable, app-chosen key identifying the logical check across attempts.

`checkRuns[0].name` string Required

Human-facing check-run name.

`checkRuns[0].status` string Required

Settable values: `CHECK_RUN_LIFECYCLE_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED`, `queued`, `in_progress`, `completed`. The schema also lists `rerequested`, which only Origin sets on re-request; a request carrying it returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`checkRuns[0].conclusion` string

Required iff `status == completed`. Allowed values: `CHECK_RUN_CONCLUSION_UNSPECIFIED`, `success`, `failure`, `neutral`, `cancelled`, `skipped`, `timed_out`, `action_required`, `stale`.

`checkRuns[0].externalUpdatedAt` string Required

The external system's last-update time. Used to order concurrent updates so a stale retry can't overwrite newer state.

`checkRuns[0].startedAt` string

When the check run started.

`checkRuns[0].completedAt` string

When the check run completed.

`checkRuns[0].detailsUrl` string

Optional link to more detail about this specific check run (e.g. the provider's job/build URL).

`checkRuns[0].externalId` string Required

Provider-assigned immutable identity for this check attempt.

`checkRuns[0].output` object

Human-readable output for this check run.

`checkRuns[0].output.title` string

Short headline for the output. Maximum length: 255 characters.

`checkRuns[0].output.summary` string

Summary of the output. May contain Markdown. Maximum UTF-8 size: 65535 bytes.

`checkRuns[0].output.text` string

Detailed output. May contain Markdown. Maximum UTF-8 size: 65535 bytes.

`checkRuns[0].deadlineAt` string

Deadline for the check run, as an RFC 3339 timestamp. Values more than 24 hours in the future are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) rather than clamped. Omit it on a create to record no deadline; omit it on an update to leave the stored deadline unchanged.

`checkRuns[0].isRerequestable` boolean

Declares that the run can be run again on request. Setting it to `true` commits your app to subscribing to [`repository.check_run.rerequested`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events) and answering each delivery by posting a fresh run for the same head SHA and `key`: either a new run under a new `externalId`, which keeps the old attempt as history, or an update of the re-requested run under the same `externalId`, which refreshes it in place. Until that fresh post arrives the re-requested run reads as pending in the commit's latest check state, so a required check blocks merging and the pull request shows the run as awaiting its re-run; declaring re-requestability without answering strands the check. Origin does not verify the subscription when you post. Omit it to keep the stored value, which is `false` on a new run; send `false` to withdraw the declaration.

### List Check Run Annotations

/v1/origin/repos///check-runs//annotations

Requires scope `repository:checks:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists a check run's annotations in ascending ID order.

Annotation IDs are time-sortable, so ascending ID order is also creation order. A page token fixes the page size and scope for the rest of the sequence, so `pageSize` is ignored once you send one.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`checkRunId` string Required

Server-assigned check run ID.

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Maximum annotations to return. Defaults to 30 when omitted or zero; values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `nextPageToken`. Omit for the first page.

#### Response Fields

`annotations` array

Page of annotations, in ascending ID order.

`annotations[].id` string

`annotations[].rawDetails` string

Raw detail text. Absent when the annotation has none.

`annotations[].createdAt` string

When the annotation was created (RFC 3339).

`annotations[].updatedAt` string

When the annotation was last updated (RFC 3339).

`annotations[].location` object

Source location. Absent for a run-level annotation.

`annotations[].location.path` string

Canonical repository-relative file path.

`annotations[].location.startLine` integer

First line of the range. 1-based and inclusive.

`annotations[].location.endLine` integer

Last line of the range. 1-based and inclusive.

`annotations[].location.columns` object

Column range. Absent unless the annotation covers a single line.

`annotations[].location.columns.startColumn` integer

First column of the range. 1-based and inclusive.

`annotations[].location.columns.endColumn` integer

Last column of the range. 1-based and inclusive.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/check-runs/CHECK_RUN_ID/annotations' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

  ]
}
```

### Create Check Run Annotations

/v1/origin/repos///check-runs//annotations

Requires scope `repository:checks:write` (installation access token).

Appends between 1 and 25 annotations to a check run in a single atomic batch.

A check run holds at most 100 annotations. A batch that would take it past that limit is rejected with `ResourceExhausted` (HTTP 429) and nothing is written; a batch outside the 1 to 25 range is rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). The operation is append-only and is not idempotent, so retrying after an ambiguous transport failure can append duplicates and consume capacity. Identical content is allowed.

#### Path Parameters

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`checkRunId` string Required

Server-assigned check run ID.

### Rerequest Check Run

/v1/origin/repos///check-runs//rerequest

Requires scope `repository:contents:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Asks the app that reported a check run to run it again. Origin records the request on the run as `rerequestedAt` and notifies the owning app with [`repository.check_run.rerequested`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events). The app answers by posting a fresh run for the same head SHA and `key`, either a new run or an update of this one, which clears `rerequestedAt` and stores the posted status. While the request is outstanding the run's `status` is `rerequested`; its `conclusion` and timings keep describing the superseded attempt. The call returns the run with `rerequestedAt` set and `status` `rerequested`.

The run must be `completed`, must carry `isRerequestable`, must be the current attempt for its `key`, and must sit on the current head of an open pull request. Anything else returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

One re-request can be outstanding per run. A repeat request while `rerequestedAt` is set returns `AlreadyExists` (HTTP 409 Conflict), and the run becomes re-requestable again once the owning app has answered. Any principal holding [`repository:contents:write`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#scopes) can re-request any re-requestable run, whichever app reported it. A `checkRunId` that is unknown, or that belongs to another repository, returns `404`.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`checkRunId` string Required

Server-assigned check-run id (`cr_...`).

Server-assigned check run identifier.

`repository` object

Repository reference for the run.

`repository.id` string

Repository identifier in a container reference.

`repository.name` string

Repository name in a container reference.

`repository.owner` object

Owner reference for the repository.

`repository.owner.slug` string

`name` string

Display-only run name; it is not used for required-check matching.

`status` string

Lifecycle status; queued, in\_progress, completed, or rerequested. A rerequested run is a completed run whose re-run was asked for and the owning app has not answered yet: treat it as pending and render it like queued.

`conclusion` string

Present for a completed or rerequested run; success, failure, neutral, cancelled, skipped, timed\_out, action\_required, or stale. On a rerequested run it is the superseded attempt's verdict, so read it only when `status` is `completed`.

`detailsUrl` string

Separate link to the provider's full result page.

`externalUpdatedAt` string

External update timestamp used to order updates so stale retries cannot replace newer state.

`startedAt` string

Provider-reported RFC 3339 start time when supplied.

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`actor.user.handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle, without the `@` prefix. Present only while that profile is publicly visible; omitted otherwise.

`actor.app` object

App variant of the actor. Set when an app performed the action.

`actor.app.id` string

Public identifier for the app.

`actor.app.displayName` string

The app's registered display name. Omitted when the app cannot be resolved and on Cursor's first-party managed actor.

Whether the reporting app declared this run re-requestable.

`rerequestedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp of the outstanding re-request. Absent when no re-request is pending, and cleared when the app that owns the run posts again. While it is set, `status` is `rerequested` and the run stays in the commit's latest check state and reads as pending, with `conclusion` and the timings still carrying the superseded result, so a required check blocks merging until the app answers.

`rerequestedBy` object

Principal that asked for the re-run, carrying the same actor variants as `actor`. Present whenever `rerequestedAt` is set, and cleared together with it.

```bash

### List Check Runs For Commit

/v1/origin/repos///commits//check-runs

Requires scope `repository:checks:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists a commit's current check runs across all suites: only runs belonging to each suite's latest attempt, and within each suite only the latest attempt per run key. Superseded attempts are omitted. A run that has been re-requested stays in the listing and reads as pending, with `status` `rerequested` and `rerequestedAt` set, and its superseded `conclusion` and timings unchanged, until the app that owns it answers. Read a superseded attempt by its own id with [Get Check Run](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-check-run). Optionally filtered by check name and status. Paginated.

Filters apply to the collapsed set, so a run matches on its latest attempt's status and a filter never resurfaces a superseded attempt. Page tokens embed the filters they were minted under, so a token replayed under different filters is rejected; restart pagination when a filter changes.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`sha` string Required

Commit SHA (40- or 64-char hex) to list check runs for.

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Max check runs to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page. Encodes the last-seen check-run id scoped to this commit and to the filters below, so `page_size` on a follow-up request is ignored when a token is supplied, and reusing a token under different filters returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`checkName` string

Optional exact check-run name filter, matched against `checkRuns[].name`. Omit to list runs under any name.

`status` string

Optional status filter. Allowed values: `queued`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `rerequested`. Any other value returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Omit to list runs in any status.

#### Response Fields

`checkRuns` array

Paginated check runs attached to the resolved commit SHA.

`checkRuns[].conclusion` string

Present for a completed or rerequested run; success, failure, neutral, cancelled, skipped, timed\_out, action\_required, or stale. On a rerequested run it is the superseded attempt's verdict, so read it only when `status` is `completed`.

Deadline recorded for the check run, as an RFC 3339 timestamp. Absent when the run has no deadline, including after the run completes.

`checkRuns[].isRerequestable` boolean

Whether the reporting app declared this run re-requestable.

`checkRuns[].rerequestedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp of the outstanding re-request. Absent when no re-request is pending, and cleared when the app that owns the run posts again. While it is set, `status` is `rerequested` and the run stays in the commit's latest check state and reads as pending, with `conclusion` and the timings still carrying the superseded result, so a required check blocks merging until the app answers.

`checkRuns[].rerequestedBy` object

Principal that asked for the re-run, carrying the same actor variants as `actor`. Present whenever `rerequestedAt` is set, and cleared together with it.

`nextPageToken` string

Opaque cursor for the next page; empty when there are no more pages.

### List Check Suites For Commit

/v1/origin/repos///commits//check-suites

Requires scope `repository:checks:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists check suites reported against a commit. Returns only the latest attempt of each suite, per reporting actor and suite key; superseded attempts are omitted. Read a superseded attempt by its own id with [Get Check Suite](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-check-suite). Returns suite metadata only (no embedded runs). Paginated.

## Commits and contents

A commit separates git-object metadata under `commit` from top-level repository relationships. List responses omit `stats`; [Get Commit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-commit) includes whole-commit aggregate `stats`. Changed files are returned only by the paginated [List Commit Files](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-commit-files) collection. `author` and `committer` are git identities recorded in the commit, not Origin user objects.

A comparison is a summary only: it never embeds commit lists or file diffs. `status` is exactly `identical`, `ahead`, `behind`, or `diverged`; `aheadBy` and `behindBy` are commit counts. `baseCommit`, `headCommit`, and `mergeBaseCommit` use the sparse commit projection (no `stats` or files).

### List Commits

/v1/origin/repos///commits

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists commits on a branch or starting ref.

List results omit `stats`. Use [Get Commit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-commit) for aggregate stats and [List Commit Files](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-commit-files) for the paginated file diff.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Query Parameters

`sha` string

SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic ref (for example `HEAD`) to start listing from. Empty means the repo's default branch.

`pageSize` integer

Max commits to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page. Encodes the starting ref and page, so `sha`/`page_size` on a follow-up request are ignored when a token is supplied.

#### Response Fields

`commits` array

Sparse commits with no stats; changed files are not embedded.

`commits[].sha` string

Full commit SHA.

`commits[].commit` object

Git-object metadata nested separately from top-level repository relationships.

### List Commit Files

/v1/origin/repos///commits//files

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists the files changed by a commit.

`sha` may be a commit SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic ref such as `HEAD`. Results default to 30 files and are capped at 100. A page token fixes the resolved commit, page size, and file cursor; on later requests, `sha` and `pageSize` must match the token. Each file includes `filename`, `status`, `additions`, `deletions`, `changes`, `patch`, and `previousFilename` when renamed or copied. `patch` is empty for binary files.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`sha` string Required

SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic ref (for example `HEAD`) of the commit whose files should be listed.

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Max changed files to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page. The token fixes the resolved commit, page size, and file cursor, so `sha` and `page_size` on a follow-up request must match the token.

#### Response Fields

`files` array

Paginated changed files with filename, status, line counts, patch, and previousFilename for renamed or copied files. Binary patches are empty.

`files[].filename` string

Path of the changed file.

`files[].status` string

Change status; added, removed, modified, renamed, or copied.

`files[].additions` integer

Added line count for the file.

`files[].deletions` integer

`files[].changes` integer

Total changed line count for the file.

`files[].patch` string

Unified patch; empty for binary files.

`files[].previousFilename` string

Previous path when the file was renamed or copied.

`nextPageToken` string

Token fixes the resolved commit, page size, and file cursor; subsequent sha and pageSize values must match it.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/commits/SHA/files' \

```

### Compare Commits

/v1/origin/repos///compare/

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Compares commits, refs, or tags relative to their merge base. `basehead` is `"{base}...{head}"`; refs containing "/" must use their SHA.

`base` and `head` may each be a SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic ref such as `HEAD`. The response is an unpaginated summary: `status` is `identical`, `ahead`, `behind`, or `diverged`; the three commit objects are sparse and omit `stats` and files. No `totalCommits`, embedded `commits`, or `files` fields are returned. Unrelated histories return `404`.

#### Path Parameters

### List Comparison Files

/v1/origin/repos///compare//files

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists the files changed by a comparison: the diff of `head` against the merge base of `base` and `head`.

`basehead` is `"{base}...{head}"`; refs containing "/" must use their SHA. The file list always agrees with the summary from [Compare Commits](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#compare-commits), so an `identical` or `behind` comparison returns an empty list, and unrelated histories return `404`. Results default to 30 files and are capped at 100. Each file carries the same fields as [List Commit Files](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-commit-files).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`basehead` string Required

`"{base}...{head}"`, where either revision may be a SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic ref such as `HEAD`.

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Max changed files to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page. The token is bound to the resolved comparison, page size, and file cursor, so `basehead` and `page_size` on a follow-up request must match the token. Origin re-resolves the comparison on every page; when its commits have moved since the token was issued, the request returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) and listing must restart from the first page.

#### Response Fields

`files` array

Paginated changed files with filename, status, line counts, patch, and previousFilename for renamed or copied files. Binary patches are empty.

`files[].filename` string

Path of the changed file.

`files[].status` string

Change status; added, removed, modified, renamed, or copied.

`files[].additions` integer

Added line count for the file.

`files[].deletions` integer

Deleted line count for the file.

`files[].changes` integer

Total changed line count for the file.

`files[].patch` string

Unified patch; empty for binary files.

`files[].previousFilename` string

Previous path when the file was renamed or copied.

`nextPageToken` string

Opaque cursor for the next page; empty when there are no more files.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/compare/BASE...HEAD/files' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "files": [
    {
      "filename": "src/telemetry.ts",
      "status": "modified",
      "additions": 6,

      "changes": 9,
      "patch": "@@ -12,6 +12,9 @@\n import { ignite } from \"./ignition\";\n+import { emitLaunchTelemetry } from \"./telemetry\";\n"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Get Contents

/v1/origin/repos///contents

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns file or directory contents at a ref. The file path is passed as the `path` query parameter (supports nested paths); omit or leave empty for the repository root directory. Files larger than 1 MiB (decoded) are rejected with `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

Files contain base64 content. Directories contain immediate children in `entries`. Directory entries are sparse children containing `type`, `name`, `path`, `sha`, and `size`; fetch a child path to read its content.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Query Parameters

`path` string

Path to the file or directory relative to the repository root. Empty requests the root directory.

`ref` string

Commit, branch, tag, or symbolic ref (for example `HEAD`) to read from. Empty means the repository's default branch.

#### Response Fields

`type` string

Content kind; file or dir.

`encoding` string

File encoding; file responses use base64.

`size` string

Decoded content size in bytes, encoded as a JSON string under the API's 64-bit integer convention. File payloads larger than 1 MiB are rejected.

`name` string

Base name of the file or directory.

`path` string

Path relative to the repository root.

`sha` string

Blob SHA for a file or tree SHA for a directory.

`content` string

Base64-encoded file body; present for a fetched file.

`entries` array

Immediate sparse children of a directory. Entries contain type, name, path, sha, and size; fetch a child path to read its content.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/contents' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "type": "file",
  "encoding": "base64",
  "size": "312",
  "name": "telemetry.ts",
  "path": "src/telemetry.ts",
  "sha": "c9d8e7f6a5b4c3d2e1f0a9b8c7d6e5f4a3b2c1d0",
  "content": "Y29uc29sZS5sb2coImxhdW5jaCIpOwo="
}
```

### Batch Get Contents

/v1/origin/repos///contents:batchGet

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns the contents of several explicit paths at a ref in one request. Each requested path yields a result marking whether it was found; a found path carries the same `Content` shape as `GetContents` (files as base64, directories as immediate `entries`, symlinks as files). Paths are matched exactly, with no globs or patterns, and at most 20 may be requested; duplicates are removed. Response results preserve first-seen request order. A single file larger than the [Get Contents](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-contents) 1 MiB cap fails the whole batch with `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400). Uses POST because the path list travels in the request body.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`paths` array Required

Exact paths to fetch, relative to the repository root (no globs or patterns). At most 20 entries; duplicates are removed. An empty string requests the repository root directory.

`ref` string

Commit, branch, tag, or symbolic ref (for example `HEAD`) to read from. Empty means the repository's default branch.

#### Response Fields

`results` array

One result per returned exact path, preserving first-seen request order.

`results[].path` string

Requested path corresponding to this result.

`results[].found` boolean

Whether the requested path exists at the resolved commit.

`results[].content` object

Content value when found is true; omitted when found is false.

`results[].content.type` string

Content kind; file or dir.

`results[].content.encoding` string

File encoding; file responses use base64.

`results[].content.size` string

Decoded content size in bytes, encoded as a JSON string under the API's 64-bit integer convention. File payloads larger than 1 MiB are rejected.

`results[].content.name` string

Base name of the file or directory.

`results[].content.path` string

Path relative to the repository root.

`results[].content.sha` string

Blob SHA for a file or tree SHA for a directory.

`results[].content.content` string

Base64-encoded file body; present for a fetched file.

`results[].content.entries` array

Immediate sparse children of a directory. Entries contain type, name, path, sha, and size; fetch a child path to read its content.

`resolvedCommitSha` string

Commit SHA to which the requested ref resolved.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/contents:batchGet' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "paths": [
    "src/telemetry.ts"
  ],
  "ref": "main"
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "path": "src/telemetry.ts",
      "found": true,
      "content": {
        "type": "file",
        "encoding": "base64",

    }
  ],
  "resolvedCommitSha": "9a41f0c3d2b8e7f6a5c4d3e2f1b0a9c8d7e6f5a4"
}
```

### Grep Contents

/v1/origin/repos//:grep

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Searches the text of the files in the repository at a ref and returns the lines that match, plus any requested surrounding context lines. The search is line-oriented: a pattern never matches across a line break, and each returned entry is one line. The repository is scanned for every request, so there is no pagination and no cursor; the response is complete only when `limitHit` is false. An empty repository with no refs returns no matches and `limitHit` false. Uses POST because the search parameters travel in the request body.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`ref` string

Commit, branch, tag, or symbolic ref (for example `HEAD`) to search. Empty means the repository's default branch.

`query` string Required

The pattern to search for. By default it is a regular expression supporting character classes, quantifiers, alternation, groups, and anchors; set `literal` to search for the text exactly instead. Whitespace is significant and is searched for as given. An empty pattern returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Maximum UTF-8 size: 4096 bytes.

`literal` boolean

Search for `query` as exact text rather than as a regular expression.

`caseInsensitive` boolean

Match upper and lower case as equivalent.

`wholeWord` boolean

Match only complete words.

`contextBefore` integer

How many lines immediately before each matching line to return as context. Values above 10 are reduced to 10.

`contextAfter` integer

How many lines immediately after each matching line to return as context. Values above 10 are reduced to 10.

`filterPath` string

Restrict the search to this file or directory, relative to the repository root. Empty searches the whole repository. Maximum UTF-8 size: 4096 bytes.

`includes` array

Glob patterns naming the paths to search. Matching is case-insensitive; a pattern containing no `/` matches at any depth, `*` matches within one path segment, and `**` matches across segments. When any include is present, a path matching none of them is not searched. At most 20 entries. Maximum UTF-8 size per pattern: 4096 bytes.

`excludes` array

Glob patterns naming paths to leave out, in the same syntax as `includes`. An exclude beats an include, and excluding a directory leaves out everything beneath it. At most 20 entries. Maximum UTF-8 size per pattern: 4096 bytes.

`maxResults` integer

The most matching occurrences to return. Zero requests the default of 1000, and values above 1000 are reduced to 1000. Context lines do not count toward the cap.

#### Response Fields

`matches` array

The matching lines and their context lines. The order in which files and lines appear is unspecified and can differ between identical requests.

`matches[].path` string

Path to the file, relative to the repository root.

`matches[].lineNumber` integer

One-based line number of this line within the file.

`matches[].line` string

The line's text, without its trailing line terminator.

`matches[].kind` string

Whether this line carries matches or was returned as context. Allowed values: `match`, `context`.

`matches[].submatches` array

Where the matches sit inside `line`. Always empty on a context line. When `limitHit` is true, the last matching line can carry only some of its matches. Ranges that fall entirely past `line` are omitted, and ranges that would extend past `line` are reduced to the bytes that remain.

`matches[].submatches[].start` integer

Byte offset of the first byte of the match within the line.

`matches[].submatches[].end` integer

Byte offset one past the last byte of the match within the line.

`limitHit` boolean

Whether the search reached `maxResults`. Narrow `query`, `filterPath`, or the glob lists to search a smaller set of files.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME:grep' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \

## Git data

Low-level git objects. Reads need `repository:contents:read`, and an empty repository returns `409`. [Create Commit From Files](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-commit-from-files) and [Create Git Ref](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-git-ref) write git objects and need `repository:contents:write`.

### Get Blob

/v1/origin/repos///git/blobs/

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns a Git blob object by SHA. Default response is JSON with MIME-wrapped base64 `content`. Pass `Accept: application/vnd.origin.raw+json` (or `application/vnd.origin.raw`) on the REST surface to receive raw blob bytes instead. Blobs larger than 4 MiB (decoded) are rejected; fetch larger files by cloning the repository over [Git HTTPS](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#git-https-authentication). Empty repositories return 409 Conflict.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`sha` string Required

Full or abbreviated hex SHA of the blob object.

#### Response Fields

`sha` string

Git blob object SHA.

`size` integer

Decoded blob size as a JSON number; blobs larger than 4 MiB are rejected by the JSON endpoint.

`encoding` string

JSON blob responses use base64 encoding.

`content` string

Base64-encoded blob bytes; callers may request raw bytes with Accept: application/vnd.origin.raw.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/git/blobs/SHA' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "sha": "c9d8e7f6a5b4c3d2e1f0a9b8c7d6e5f4a3b2c1d0",
  "size": 312,
  "encoding": "base64",
  "content": "Y29uc29sZS5sb2coImxhdW5jaCIpOwo="
}
```

### Get Git Commit

/v1/origin/repos///git/commits/

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns a Git commit object by SHA (or resolvable revision). This is the low-level Git Database commit shape (flat author/message/tree), not the higher-level `GetCommit` resource under `/commits/{sha}`. `sha` accepts a commit SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic ref such as `HEAD`. Empty repositories return 409 Conflict.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`sha` string Required

Full or abbreviated hex SHA of the commit object, or a branch, tag, or symbolic ref such as `HEAD`.

#### Response Fields

`sha` string

Full hex commit SHA.

`author` object

Author signature from the git object.

`author.name` string

Name recorded in the Git identity.

`author.email` string

Email recorded in the Git identity.

`author.date` string

ISO-8601 timestamp preserving the git signature's original timezone offset (e.g. "2014-11-07T22:01:45+01:00").

`committer` object

Committer signature from the git object.

`committer.name` string

Name recorded in the Git identity.

`committer.email` string

Email recorded in the Git identity.

`committer.date` string

ISO-8601 timestamp preserving the git signature's original timezone offset (e.g. "2014-11-07T22:01:45+01:00").

`message` string

Full commit message.

`tree` object

Tree this commit points at.

`tree.sha` string

SHA of the tree referenced by the commit.

`parents` array

Parent commit SHAs (empty for a root commit).

`parents[].sha` string

Parent commit SHA.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/git/commits/SHA' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json

    }
  ]
}
```

### Create Commit From Files

/v1/origin/repos///git/commits:createFromFiles

Requires scope `repository:contents:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Creates a commit on a branch from inline file changes and advances the branch to it.

The changes apply to the tree at `expectedHeadSha`, which becomes the new commit's parent. A branch that has moved or does not exist, a set of changes that leaves the tree unchanged, a delete of a path the tree does not hold, a write a push ruleset blocks, and a repository whose contents are mirrored from another host each return `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

One request carries at most 1,000 file changes, 8 MiB per file, and 32 MiB of content in total. Exceeding a limit, repeating a path, or sending a malformed field returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400), with `google.rpc.BadRequest` field violations naming the offending `files[i]` entry.

The branch must already exist. Create it with [Create Git Ref](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-git-ref) first, then commit onto it.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`targetBranch` string Required

Branch that receives the commit, as `<branch>`, `heads/<branch>`, or `refs/heads/<branch>`. The branch must already exist. `HEAD` is rejected in every spelling.

`expectedHeadSha` string Required

Full hex SHA the target branch must currently point at. It becomes the new commit's parent. The all-zeros SHA is rejected.

`message` string Required

Commit message.

`author` object Required

Commit author. Timestamps are assigned by the server.

`author.name` string Required

Name recorded in the Git identity.

`author.email` string Required

Email recorded in the Git identity.

`committer` object

Commit committer. Defaults to `author` when omitted.

`committer.name` string

Name recorded in the Git identity. Required when `committer` is present.

`committer.email` string

Email recorded in the Git identity. Required when `committer` is present.

`files` array Required

File changes applied to the branch tip's tree. At least one change is required, and paths must be unique within a request.

`files[].path` string Required

Repository-relative path using `/` separators, for example `docs/changelog.md`.

`files[].content` string

New file contents, encoded per `files[].encoding`. Creates the file or replaces its contents. Set exactly one of `files[].content` and `files[].delete`.

`files[].delete` boolean

Removes the file. Must be `true` when set. Set exactly one of `files[].content` and `files[].delete`.

`files[].encoding` string

Encoding of `files[].content`. Allowed values: `utf-8` (default), `base64`. Ignored for a delete.

`files[].mode` string

File mode for `files[].content`. Allowed values: `file` (default), `executable`, `symlink`, where the contents are the link target. Ignored for a delete.

#### Response Fields

`sha` string

SHA of the new commit, now the branch tip.

`treeSha` string

SHA of the new commit's root tree.

`previousHeadSha` string

Branch tip before the write; the new commit's parent.

### Get Git Ref

/v1/origin/repos///git/ref/

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns a single Git reference by name. `ref` is typically `heads/<branch>` or `tags/<tag>` (with or without a leading `refs/`), or the symbolic `HEAD`. Exact match only; use ListMatchingGitRefs for prefixes. Empty repositories return 409 Conflict.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`ref` string Required

Git reference name. Typically `heads/<branch>` or `tags/<tag>`; a leading `refs/` is accepted and normalized. The symbolic `HEAD` is also accepted (returned as `ref: "HEAD"` with the tip commit). Exact match on the full ref name.

#### Response Fields

`ref` string

Full ref name, e.g. "refs/heads/main".

`object` object

Object this ref points at directly (unpeeled). For annotated tags, `object.type` is "tag" and `object.sha` is the tag object SHA.

`object.sha` string

Hex SHA of the target object.

`object.type` string

One of "commit", "tree", "blob", or "tag".

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/git/ref/REF' \

  }
}
```

### Create Git Ref

/v1/origin/repos///git/refs

Requires scope `repository:contents:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Creates a branch reference pointing at an existing commit.

Only branch references can be created. A tag or any other reference namespace, and a `sha` that is not the full hex SHA of a commit in the repository, return `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Creating a branch that already points at `sha` succeeds and returns the existing reference; a branch that exists at any other commit returns `AlreadyExists` (HTTP 409 Conflict). A create a push ruleset blocks, or one on a repository whose contents are mirrored from another host, returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`ref` string Required

Branch reference to create, as `refs/heads/<branch>` or `heads/<branch>`.

Full hex SHA of an existing commit that the new branch points at.

#### Response Fields

`ref` string

Full ref name, e.g. "refs/heads/main".

`object` object

Object this ref points at directly (unpeeled). For a branch, `object.type` is "commit".

`object.sha` string

Hex SHA of the target object.

`object.type` string

One of "commit", "tree", "blob", or "tag".

## Grants

A grant binds one principal to one repository or one owner with one permission. These endpoints read, set, and remove the grants held directly on a resource, so access changes can be scripted and reviewed like code. Writes reuse the checks behind the Codebase permissions UI and record the same `repository.access_changed` and `namespace.access_changed` audit events. For the principal kinds, the two permission ladders, and how owner-level grants interact with repository-level ones, read [Origin Grants API](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/grants-api).

### List Repository Grants

/v1/origin/repos///grants

Requires scope `repository:settings:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists the users, groups, and owning-team groups holding a permission granted directly on a repository. Permissions inherited from the repository's owner are not included.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Max grants to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100. Ignored when `pageToken` is set.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page.

#### Response Fields

`grants` array

Grants held directly on the repository, ordered by principal kind (groups, owning-team admins, owning-team members, users) and then by id. A principal that no longer resolves to an active user, group, or owning team is omitted, so a page can hold fewer than `pageSize` grants.

`grants[].user` object

A user principal. Exactly one of `user`, `group`, or `teamGroup` is present.

`grants[].user.id` string

Public identifier for the user, prefixed `user_`.

`grants[].user.email` string

Email address of the user.

`grants[].user.displayName` string

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`grants[].user.handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle, without the `@` prefix. Present only while that profile is publicly visible; omitted otherwise.

`grants[].group` object

A Cursor organization group principal.

`grants[].group.id` string

Public identifier for the group, prefixed `grp_`.

`grants[].teamGroup` object

One of the owning team's built-in groups, granted on the repository itself and distinct from the one inherited from the owner.

`grants[].teamGroup.kind` string

Which built-in group holds the grant. Allowed values: `members`, `admins`.

`grants[].permission` string

Permission the principal holds on the repository. Allowed values: `read`, `write`, `admin`, `custom`. `custom` reports a custom policy, which [Upsert Repository Grant](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#upsert-repository-grant) does not accept.

`repository` object

The repository every grant in this response belongs to. Carries the same fields as [Get Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-repo).

`nextPageToken` string

Opaque cursor for the next page; empty when there are no more pages.

```

### Delete Repository Grant

/v1/origin/repos///grants

Requires scope `repository:settings:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Removes the permission a user, group, or owning-team group holds directly on a repository.

  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "user": {
    "id": "user_01k2ja2000e0080000000000c3"
  },

### Delete Namespace Grant

/v1/origin/owners//grants

Requires scope `namespace:settings:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Removes the permission a user, group, or owning-team group holds directly on an owner. Per-repository grants are unaffected.

## Labels

A label definition belongs to one repository and is addressed by its name. Assigning labels to a pull request is a separate surface; see [Set Pull Request Labels](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#set-pull-request-labels).

### List Labels

/v1/origin/repos///labels

Requires scope `repository:labels:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists the labels defined on a repository, ordered by name.

Page tokens are bound to the repository they were minted for. A token replayed against a different repository, or any other malformed token, returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Maximum labels to return. Defaults to 30 when omitted or zero; values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `nextPageToken`. Omit for the first page.

#### Response Fields

`labels` array

Page of label definitions, ordered by name.

`labels[].id` string

Public identifier for the label.

`labels[].name` string

Label name, unique within the repository. Names address the label in the read and write endpoints.

`labels[].color` string

Six-character hex color without a leading `#`.

`labels[].description` string

Label description. Absent when the label has none.

`nextPageToken` string

Opaque cursor for the next page. Empty when there are no more results.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/labels' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json

  ]
}
```

### Create Label

/v1/origin/repos///labels

Requires scope `repository:labels:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Creates a label on a repository.

A name already used by another label on the repository returns `AlreadyExists` (HTTP 409 Conflict). A `color` that is not six hexadecimal characters, a `name` longer than 50 characters, or a `description` longer than 255 characters returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`name` string Required

Label name. Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed. Maximum length: 50 characters.

`color` string Required

Six-character hex color without a leading `#`. Uppercase input is stored lowercase.

`description` string

Label description. Maximum length: 255 characters.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Public identifier for the label.

`name` string

Label name, unique within the repository. Names address the label in the read and write endpoints.

`color` string

Six-character hex color without a leading `#`.

`description` string

Label description. Absent when the label has none.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/labels' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

  "description": "Something isn't working"
}
```

### Get Label

/v1/origin/repos///labels/

Requires scope `repository:labels:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns a single repository label by name.

An unknown name returns `404`. An empty `labelName` returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`labelName` string Required

Label name. Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed before lookup.

  "name": "bug",
  "color": "d73a4a",
  "description": "Something isn't working"
}
```

### Delete Label

/v1/origin/repos///labels/

Requires scope `repository:labels:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Deletes a repository label by name. The response body is empty.

Deleting a label also removes it from every pull request it was assigned to. An unknown name returns `404`. An empty `labelName` returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

204 No Content
```

### Update Label

/v1/origin/repos///labels/

Requires scope `repository:labels:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Updates a repository label identified by its current name.

Omitted fields are left unchanged, and a request that omits all three returns the label as it stands. Renaming to a name another label already uses returns `AlreadyExists` (HTTP 409 Conflict). An unknown `labelName` returns `404`.

}
```

## Pull requests

Closed or merged pull requests may additionally include `closedAt`, `mergedAt`, and `mergeCommitSha`. Treat `head.ref` and `base.ref` as opaque Origin ref strings; they may be short branch names or fully qualified `refs/heads/…` values.

Review `verdict` is `approve`, `request_changes`, or `comment`. `submittedAt` is absent for an unsubmitted draft review. `dismissal` is absent while the verdict remains active. Dismissed reviews remain visible in review listings. Reviews automatically superseded by a newer decision carry a server-generated message.

Comments expose a `thread` reference for grouping. Create-comment requests still accept the scalar `threadId` command parameter when replying. Resolve or reopen a thread with [Update Pull Request Thread](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#update-pull-request-thread).

### List Pull Requests

/v1/origin/repos///pulls

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists pull requests in a repo, optionally filtered by head branch, base branch, author, creation-time range, and state. Each pull request includes its assigned labels.

Results are sorted by creation order or by last update, selected with `sortBy`, most recent first. Set `direction=asc` for the other order. Page tokens embed the sort and the filters they were minted under, so a token replayed under a different sort or filter set is rejected; restart pagination when either changes.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Query Parameters

`head` string

Optional exact branch (head-ref) filter. Omit to list across every branch.

`state` string

Lifecycle filter. Allowed values: `open` (the default), `closed`, `merged`, `all`. `closed` covers every pull request that is no longer open, merged ones included; `merged` narrows to the merged subset. Any other value returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`pageSize` integer

Maximum results to return. Defaults to 30; maximum 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `nextPageToken`. Omit it for the first page.

`author` string

Optional author filter. Pass a public actor ID exactly as this endpoint returns it in `pullRequests[].author.user.id`, `pullRequests[].author.app.id`, or `pullRequests[].author.serviceAccount.id` (`user_…`, `app_…`, or `sa_…`), or the exact email address of a user. Email matching is case-insensitive. Apps and service accounts have no email identity, so only user authors can be selected that way. An author with no pull requests returns an empty list, as does an email that resolves to no single user. Any other value, including the shared `origin-cursor-managed-actor` ID, returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`base` string

Optional exact base-branch filter. Accepts a short name (`main`) or a fully qualified ref (`refs/heads/main`). Omit to list across every base.

`direction` string

Sort direction along `sortBy`. `"desc"` is the default: with `sortBy=created` it returns the most recently created first, and with `sortBy=updated` the most recently updated first. `"asc"` reverses each. Any other value returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`since` string

Optional inclusive lower bound on creation time, as an RFC 3339 timestamp such as `2026-08-01T00:00:00Z`. Returns only pull requests created at or after that instant. A malformed timestamp returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`until` string

Optional inclusive upper bound on creation time, in the same RFC 3339 format as `since`. Returns only pull requests created at or before that instant. A malformed timestamp returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`sortBy` string

Sort key. Allowed values: `created` (creation order, the default) or `updated` (time of last update). Any other value returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

### Create Pull Request

/v1/origin/repos///pulls

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Creates a pull request from `head` into `base`.

Optional `parent_pull_number` stacks this change on another open or draft pull request in the same repository.

A `title` longer than 256 characters, or a `body` longer than 65,536 characters, returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Both limits count Unicode code points.

A `head` with no history in common with `base` returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) and creates nothing. If a later push leaves an open pull request's head disjoint from its base, Origin closes the pull request and delivers [`pull_request.closed`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events); a subsequent related push does not reopen it.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

#### Request Body

`title` string Required

`base` string Required

Target branch name (what the change merges into). Must name a branch that exists in the repo at call time. A commit SHA, a tag name, or a branch that does not exist returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`draft` boolean

When true, create as a draft. When false or omitted, create as open (ready for review).

`parentPullNumber` string

### Update Pull Request

/v1/origin/repos///pulls/

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Updates a pull request's title, body, base branch, and/or lifecycle state.

Omitted fields are unchanged. Present fields are applied in order: metadata, then reopen/draft/ready-for-review, then base, then close. Close runs last so a same-request retarget can still see an open change; reopen runs before base so a closed pull can be retargeted. If a later step fails, earlier steps may already have been committed.

A `title` longer than 256 characters, or a `body` longer than 65,536 characters, returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Both limits count Unicode code points.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`state` string

`"open"` or `"closed"`. `"closed"` closes the pull request. `"open"` without `draft: true` marks it ready for review, including publishing an existing draft. Merged is not writable. use `MergePullRequest`.

`draft` boolean

`true` marks the pull request draft; `false` marks it ready for review (and reopens it if currently closed). Ignored when `state` is `"closed"`.

`base` string

New base branch. Retargets the pull request and can update stack parentage when the new base is another change's head (or the default branch). Must name a branch that exists in the repo at call time; a commit SHA, a tag name, or a branch that does not exist returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Response Fields

### List Pull Request Comments

/v1/origin/repos///pulls//comments

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists every comment on a pull request in chronological order, optionally bounded to a creation-time window. Each comment carries its full thread: id, diff anchor, and resolution state. Group the flat response by `thread.id` without a second request.

Page tokens embed the filters they were minted under, so a token replayed with different filters is rejected; restart pagination when a filter changes.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Maximum comments to return. Defaults to 30; maximum 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `nextPageToken`. Omit it for the first page.

`since` string

Optional inclusive lower bound on comment creation time, as an RFC 3339 timestamp such as `2026-08-01T00:00:00Z`. Returns only comments created at or after that instant. A malformed timestamp returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`until` string

Optional inclusive upper bound on comment creation time, in the same RFC 3339 format as `since`. Returns only comments created at or before that instant. A malformed timestamp returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`threadIds` array

Optional thread IDs that restrict the listing to comments in those threads. Omit to return every comment on the pull request. Duplicates are ignored, so the limit of 20 applies to distinct IDs. A longer list, or an empty ID, returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Response Fields

`comments` array

Visible general and inline comments as one flat chronological list; group them by thread.id.

`comments[].id` string

### Create Pull Request Comment

/v1/origin/repos///pulls//comments

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Creates a comment on an Origin pull request. The comment targets exactly one of four things: `threadId` replies to an existing thread, general-discussion and inline alike; `inline` opens a new thread anchored to a line range in the pull request version's diff; `file` opens a new thread on a whole file in that diff; supplying none of them opens a new general-discussion thread. Bodies longer than 65,536 characters are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

An `inline` anchor must reference the version's diff. The `path` must be part of that diff, and the `side` must have content there, so anchoring `left` on an added file or `right` on a deleted file is rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Any line of a changed file anchors, and the range is not restricted to the diff's hunks. The range must fit the file on the anchored side, which `left` reads at the base commit and `right` at the head: a range running past the last line is rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Origin never falls back to a general-discussion comment when an anchor is invalid.

A `file` anchor carries the path alone. Origin derives the side from the file's change kind, the base version for a deleted file and the head version otherwise, and returns it on `thread.side`. Send the deleted path for a deletion and the head path for every other change. A path outside the diff is rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400), as is a renamed file's pre-rename source path.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

#### Request Body

`body` string Required

Comment text. Maximum length: 65,536 characters, counted as Unicode code points.

`threadId` string

Existing thread id to reply to. Omit to open a new thread. Cannot be combined with `versionNumber`.

`inline` object

Diff anchor for a new inline thread. Cannot be combined with `threadId`.

`inline.path` string Required

File path in the pull request version's diff.

`inline.side` string Required

Diff side of the anchor. Allowed values: `left` for the base version of the file, `right` for the head version.

`inline.startLine` integer Required

First 1-based line of the anchored range in the `side` version of the file. The range must not run past the end of that file.

`inline.endLine` integer

Inclusive last line of the anchored range. Must be greater than or equal to `startLine`. Omit for a single-line anchor.

`file` object

Anchor for a new file-level thread on a whole file in the pull request version's diff. Cannot be combined with `threadId` or `inline`.

`file.path` string Required

File path in the pull request version's diff: the deleted path for a deletion, the head path otherwise.

### Set Pull Request Labels

/v1/origin/repos///pulls//labels

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Replaces every label assigned to a pull request with the labels you name.

An empty list removes every assigned label. The labels must already exist in the repository; an unknown name or an unknown pull request returns `404`. A pull request can have at most 100 labels, so naming more than 100 returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400). The response lists the labels assigned after the replacement, ordered by name.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

#### Request Body

`labels` array

Label names to assign. Maximum 100. An empty list removes every assigned label. Duplicate names are ignored.

#### Response Fields

`labels` array

Labels assigned after the replacement, ordered by name. Each entry carries `id`, `name`, `color`, and `description`.

```bash
curl --request PUT \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/labels' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "labels": [
    "bug"
  ]
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "id": "lbl_01k2ja2000e0080000000000m1",
      "name": "bug",
      "color": "d73a4a",
      "description": "Something isn't working"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Add Pull Request Labels

/v1/origin/repos///pulls//labels

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Adds existing repository labels to a pull request.

Labels already assigned to the pull request stay assigned. The labels must already exist in the repository; an unknown name or an unknown pull request returns `404`. The request must name between 1 and 100 labels, and a pull request can have at most 100 labels in total, so a request that would take it past that limit returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400). The response lists the labels you named, not the pull request's full set; read the full set with [List Pull Request Labels](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-pull-request-labels).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

#### Request Body

`labels` array Required

Label names to add. Maximum 100. Duplicate names are ignored.

#### Response Fields

`labels` array

Labels named in the request. Each entry carries `id`, `name`, `color`, and `description`.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/labels' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "labels": [
    "bug"
  ]
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "id": "lbl_01k2ja2000e0080000000000m1",
      "name": "bug",
      "color": "d73a4a",
      "description": "Something isn't working"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Remove All Pull Request Labels

/v1/origin/repos///pulls//labels

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Removes every label from a pull request.

The request succeeds when the pull request has no labels. An unknown pull request returns `404`. The response body is empty.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/labels' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

### Remove Pull Request Label

/v1/origin/repos///pulls//labels/

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Removes one label from a pull request.

A label that is not assigned to the pull request returns `404`, as does an unknown pull request. The response lists the labels remaining on the pull request, ordered by name.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

`labelName` string Required

Name of the label to remove.

#### Response Fields

`labels` array

Labels remaining on the pull request, ordered by name. Each entry carries `id`, `name`, `color`, and `description`.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/labels/LABEL_NAME' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "id": "lbl_01k2ja2000e0080000000000m1",
      "name": "bug",
      "color": "d73a4a",
      "description": "Something isn't working"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Merge Pull Request

/v1/origin/repos///pulls//merge

Requires scope `repository:contents:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Merges a pull request into its base.

For a stacked pull request, merges the entire root-to-target prefix ending at this pull number. not only this pull. Supported only on native Origin repositories; mirrored repositories are rejected.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

Pull number to merge. When this pull is stacked, the merge lands every pull from the stack root through this number.

#### Request Body

`expectedHeadSha` string

Guard against merging a head your app has not seen: the full commit SHA (40 or 64 hexadecimal characters) expected to be the pull request's current head. When the head has moved, the merge is rejected with `ABORTED` (HTTP 409 Conflict) and nothing merges. Values that are not a full commit SHA are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Omit to merge whatever the current head is. Not evaluated when the pull request is already merged, which returns idempotent success.

`mergeMethod` string

How the pull request lands. Allowed values: `merge`, which writes a merge commit, and `squash`, which writes a single squash commit. A method the repository does not allow is rejected with `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400), and any other value with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Omit it to use the repository's default: a merge commit when the repository allows one, otherwise a squash, and a squash when the base branch requires linear history.

### Get Pull Request Mergeability

/v1/origin/repos///pulls//mergeability

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns whether the pull request can be merged and, when it cannot, the conditions that block it. The verdict is evaluated against the same conditions [Merge Pull Request](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#merge-pull-request) enforces, so a `mergeable` verdict means a merge of the same head is expected to succeed. For a stacked pull request the verdict covers every pull request from the stack root through this one, and each blocker names the pull request it belongs to.

A stack of more than 200 pull requests in total, merged ancestors included, returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

This operation is in preview and its shape can change while the contract settles. Decode responses with unknown fields and unknown enum values tolerated, treat an unrecognized `verdict` as `blocked`, and render `blockers[].message` when you do not recognize `blockers[].kind`.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

Repository-local pull request number.

#### Query Parameters

`expectedHeadSha` string

Optional guard: the full commit SHA, 40 or 64 hexadecimal characters, expected to be the pull request's current head. When it is set and the evaluated head differs, the request returns `Aborted` (HTTP 409 Conflict) instead of a result. A value that is not a full commit SHA returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Response Fields

`pullRequest` object

The pull request the verdict is about.

`pullRequest.id` string

Stable pull request identifier.

`pullRequest.number` string

Repository-local pull request number encoded as a JSON string.

`pullRequest.repository` object

Repository container reference for the pull request.

`pullRequest.repository.id` string

Repository identifier in a container reference.

`pullRequest.repository.name` string

Repository name in a container reference.

`pullRequest.repository.owner` object

Owner reference for the repository.

`pullRequest.repository.owner.slug` string

URL-facing owner slug used with the owner ID to identify the repository owner.

`pullRequest.repository.owner.id` string

Origin owner identifier.

`pullRequest.repository.owner.type` string

Owner namespace type. Output-only. Allowed values: `team`, `user`. Omitted when unknown.

`verdict` string

Overall answer for every pull request in `evaluatedPullRequests`. Allowed values: `mergeable`, meaning merging `pullRequest` lands all of them, and `blocked`. Treat an unrecognized value as `blocked`.

`blockers` array

Everything preventing the merge, ordered by the pull request they belong to, stack root first, and then by kind. Empty when `verdict` is `mergeable`. At most one blocker per pull request per kind, except `required_checks`, which carries one per state, and `rule_failure` and `ruleset_error`, which carry one per distinct message.

`blockers[].pullRequest` object

Pull request in `evaluatedPullRequests` this blocker belongs to. Carries the same fields as `pullRequest`.

`blockers[].kind` string

Category of the blocker. Allowed values: `draft`, `closed`, `merged`, `merge_conflict`, `required_checks`, `required_approvals`, `codeowner_approval`, `behind_base`, `needs_restack`, `restack_pending`, `conflict_check_pending`, `invalid_stack`, `ruleset_error`, `rule_failure`. Kinds are added over time; a blocker whose kind postdates your client decodes with `kind` unset and is still blocking.

`blockers[].message` string

Human-readable statement of the blocker and how to clear it. Never empty, so it is what to render when `kind` is unrecognized.

`blockers[].requiredChecks` object

Set on a `required_checks` blocker.

`blockers[].requiredChecks.state` string

State shared by every check in this blocker. Allowed values: `missing`, `pending`, `failing`, `action_required`.

`blockers[].requiredChecks.checks` array

Required checks in that state.

`blockers[].requiredChecks.checks[].name` string

Name the repository rule requires.

`blockers[].requiredChecks.checks[].owner` object

Principal expected to report the check, carrying the same actor variants as a check run's `actor`.

`blockers[].requiredChecks.checks[].checkRun` object

The check run on `headSha` matching this requirement, by reference. Omitted when none has been reported, which is state `missing`. It carries only `id`, `name`, and `checkSuite.id`, because this operation is readable with [`repository:pull_requests:read`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#scopes) alone while a run's status, conclusion, output, and details URL need [`repository:checks:read`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#scopes); read those with [Get Check Run](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-check-run).

`blockers[].requiredApprovals` object

Set on a `required_approvals` blocker.

`blockers[].requiredApprovals.requiredCount` integer

Approving reviews the repository rules require.

`blockers[].requiredApprovals.approvedCount` integer

Approving reviews currently counted toward the requirement.

`blockers[].codeownerApproval` object

Set on a `codeowner_approval` blocker.

`blockers[].codeownerApproval.requirements` array

Owner sets that still need an approval.

`blockers[].codeownerApproval.requirements[].owners` array

Code owners, any one of whom can satisfy the requirement.

`blockers[].codeownerApproval.requirements[].paths` array

Changed paths this owner set covers.

`blockers[].mergeConflict` object

Set on a `merge_conflict` blocker.

`blockers[].mergeConflict.conflictedPaths` array

Paths that conflict with the base branch. At most 100 are listed.

`blockers[].mergeConflict.truncated` boolean

Whether more paths conflict than are listed.

`blockers[].mergeConflict.inheritedFromDownstack` boolean

Whether the conflict comes from a pull request below this one in the stack, so this pull request is waiting on that one rather than conflicted itself.

`blockers[].stackShape` object

Set on an `invalid_stack` blocker.

`blockers[].stackShape.reason` string

Why the stack cannot be evaluated. Allowed values: `partially_merged`, `cycle`, `missing_parent`, `cross_repository_parent`, `base_branch_missing`.

`blockers[].stackShape.relatedPullRequests` array

Other pull requests involved, when the reason names any. Each carries the same fields as `pullRequest`.

`evaluatedPullRequests` array

Pull requests a merge of `pullRequest` would land, stack root first and ending with `pullRequest`. Ancestors that already merged are history and are not listed. Exactly one element for an unstacked pull request. Each carries the same fields as `pullRequest`.

`headSha` string

Head commit of `pullRequest` that was evaluated.

`baseRef` string

Branch the evaluated pull requests merge into: the stack root's base, not this pull request's own base when it is stacked.

`baseSha` string

Tip commit of `baseRef` at `evaluatedAt`. A later push to `baseRef` can change the verdict. Empty when the base branch could not be determined, for example on an invalid stack.

`evaluatedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for when this result was evaluated. Changes after this time are not reflected; re-query to pick them up.

### List Pull Request Requested Reviewers

/v1/origin/repos///pulls//requested\_reviewers

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists the users and groups whose review is currently requested on a pull request.

A direct request clears when that user submits a review, and a group request clears when any current member of the group submits. Unsubmitted draft reviews leave the request pending, and requesting review again after a submission returns the reviewer to this list. Groups without a readable public identifier are omitted.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

Repository-local pull request number.

#### Response Fields

`users` array

Users whose review is requested. Empty when none are pending.

`users[].id` string

Encoded user identifier (`user_…`), the same format the organization API uses.

`users[].email` string

Email address of the user. Empty when the account has none.

`users[].displayName` string

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`users[].handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle, without the `@` prefix. Present only while that profile is publicly visible; omitted otherwise.

`groups` array

Groups whose review is requested. Empty when none are pending.

`groups[].id` string

Group public identifier (`grp_…`).

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/requested_reviewers' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "user_01k2ja2000e0080000000000c3",
      "email": "jane@acme.dev"
    }
  ],
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "grp_01k2ja2000e0080000000000n2"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Request Pull Request Reviewers

/v1/origin/repos///pulls//requested\_reviewers

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Requests reviews from the given users and groups on a pull request, and returns the reviewers this call requested.

Identifiers resolve against the repository's reviewer candidates by public id, user email, or group slug. Display names do not resolve. An unknown or ambiguous identifier returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) naming the identifier, and at least one non-empty entry is required across `users` and `groups`.

Requesting an already-requested reviewer bumps the request timestamp, so a reviewer who had submitted a review reappears as pending. A reviewer who is not a candidate for the repository returns `PermissionDenied` (HTTP 403).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

Repository-local pull request number.

#### Request Body

`users` array

User identifiers to request. Each entry must uniquely match a user candidate for the repository by public `user_…` id or email.

`groups` array

Group identifiers to request. Each entry must uniquely match a group candidate for the repository by public `grp_…` id, qualified group slug, or group slug.

#### Response Fields

`users` array

Users this call requested.

`users[].id` string

Encoded user identifier (`user_…`), the same format the organization API uses.

`users[].email` string

Email address of the user. Empty when the account has none.

`users[].displayName` string

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`users[].handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle, without the `@` prefix. Present only while that profile is publicly visible; omitted otherwise.

`groups` array

Groups this call requested.

`groups[].id` string

Group public identifier (`grp_…`).

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/requested_reviewers' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "users": [
    "user_01k2ja2000e0080000000000c3"
  ],
  "groups": [
    "grp_01k2ja2000e0080000000000n2"
  ]
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "user_01k2ja2000e0080000000000c3",
      "email": "jane@acme.dev"
    }
  ],
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "grp_01k2ja2000e0080000000000n2"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Remove Pull Request Requested Reviewers

/v1/origin/repos///pulls//requested\_reviewers

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Removes requested reviews from the given users and groups on a pull request. The response body is empty.

Identifiers resolve against the repository's reviewer candidates by public id, user email, or group slug. Display names do not resolve. An unknown or ambiguous identifier returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) naming the identifier, and at least one non-empty entry is required across `users` and `groups`.

Removing a user or group that is not currently requested is a no-op. An identifier that is no longer a reviewer candidate is still accepted when it is a stable public id (`user_…` or `grp_…`), so a reviewer who left the repository can be cleared.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

Repository-local pull request number.

#### Request Body

`users` array

User identifiers to remove. Each entry must uniquely match a user candidate for the repository by public `user_…` id or email.

`groups` array

Group identifiers to remove. Each entry must uniquely match a group candidate for the repository by public `grp_…` id, qualified group slug, or group slug.

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/requested_reviewers' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{

  ],
  "groups": [
    "grp_01k2ja2000e0080000000000n2"

}'
```

### Create Pull Request Review

/v1/origin/repos///pulls//reviews

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Creates and submits a review on a pull request, optionally together with its comments in one atomic request. Each comment takes the same targets [Create Pull Request Comment](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-pull-request-comment) takes: `comments[].inline` for a line range, `comments[].file` for a whole file, `comments[].threadId` for a reply, and none of them for general discussion.

The review is submitted immediately. A new `approve` or `request_changes` review supersedes the caller's prior live decision review on the same pull request, which is dismissed. Pull request authors cannot `approve` their own pull request. Fails with FAILED\_PRECONDITION while the caller has an unsubmitted draft review on the pull request.

When `comments` is set, every anchor is validated against the reviewed version's diff before anything is written, using the same in-diff check as [Create Pull Request Comment](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-pull-request-comment). If one comment fails, the whole request fails with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) and nothing is published. Comments become visible atomically with the review: no comment or event is observable until the review submits, and then each comment emits its own [pull\_request.comment.created](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events) webhook alongside the review's event.

The operation carries no idempotency key, so a retry after an ambiguous transport failure can create a second review. Call [List Pull Request Reviews](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-pull-request-reviews) before retrying.

### Dismiss Pull Request Review

/v1/origin/repos///pulls//reviews//dismissals

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Dismisses a submitted review so its verdict no longer counts toward the pull request's review state. The review itself is retained and keeps appearing in ListPullRequestReviews, with `dismissal` set.

Dismissing does not require having authored the review; write permission on the repository's pull request reviews is sufficient.

Only `approve` and `request_changes` reviews can be dismissed, and only once: a `comment` review, an unsubmitted draft review, or an already-dismissed review returns FAILED\_PRECONDITION, and repeating the call leaves the first dismissal in place. A review that does not belong to the named pull request returns NOT\_FOUND.

#### Path Parameters

### Delete Ruleset

/v1/origin/repos///rulesets/

Requires scope `repository:rulesets:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Deletes a repository ruleset by its stable Origin ID. The response body is empty.

An unknown repository and an unknown ruleset both return `404`; the message distinguishes them. A ruleset stored on a different repository reads as an unknown ruleset. An empty `rulesetId` returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`rulesetId` string Required

Stable Origin ruleset ID.

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/rulesets/RULESET_ID' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

## Webhooks

Origin sends signed HTTP `POST` requests to the app's registered HTTPS webhook URL with `content-type: application/json`.

Delivery is at least once. Deduplicate retries with `webhook-id`, durably accept the request, return `2xx` quickly, and process the event asynchronously.

Origin retries transport errors, `429`, and `5xx` responses up to seven total attempts. Retry delays are 5 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 4 minutes, and 8 minutes. Other `4xx` responses are terminal.

To confirm a receiver works before any real event reaches it, call [Ping Webhook](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#ping-webhook).

Origin delivers events for mirrored repositories, and installation event payloads list them in the selected repository arrays. Delivery does not widen what the installation can call: see [Mirrored repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#mirrored-repositories).

### Headers

| Header                    | Description                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content-type`            | `application/json`                                        |
| `user-agent`              | `Cursor-Origin-Webhook/1.0`                               |
| `webhook-id`              | Stable delivery ID and idempotency key.                   |
| `webhook-timestamp`       | Unix timestamp included in the signature.                 |
| `webhook-signature`       | `v1ed,BASE64_SIGNATURE`                                   |
| `webhook-event-type`      | Event slug for routing.                                   |
| `webhook-event-id`        | Underlying Origin event ID mirrored from the signed body. |
| `webhook-app-id`          | Target app ID.                                            |
| `webhook-installation-id` | Target installation ID.                                   |

Routing headers are conveniences. After signature verification, the body is authoritative.

### Signature verification

Use the raw request body before parsing it. Construct:

```text
lowercaseHex(SHA-256("<webhook-id>.<webhook-timestamp>.<raw-request-body>"))
```

Verify the Ed25519 signature over the UTF-8 bytes of that hexadecimal digest against an active Origin JWKS key. Reject timestamps more than five minutes from the current time.

```typescript
import {
  createHash,
  createPublicKey,
  verify,
  type JsonWebKeyInput,
} from "node:crypto";

export async function verifyOriginWebhook(
  body: Buffer,
  headers: Record<string, string | undefined>
): Promise<boolean> {
  const id = headers["webhook-id"];
  const timestamp = Number(headers["webhook-timestamp"]);
  const signature = headers["webhook-signature"]
    ?.split(/\s+/)
    .find((value) => value.startsWith("v1ed,"));

  const now = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
  if (
    !id ||
    !signature ||
    !Number.isInteger(timestamp) ||
    Math.abs(now - timestamp) > 300
  ) {
    return false;
  }

  const digest = createHash("sha256")
    .update(`${id}.${timestamp}.`)
    .update(body)
    .digest("hex");

  // Cache this response in production.
  const { keys } = await fetch(
    "https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/keys"
  ).then((response) => response.json()) as {
    keys: JsonWebKeyInput[];
  };

  return keys.some((jwk) => {
    try {
      return verify(
        null,
        Buffer.from(digest),
        createPublicKey({ key: jwk, format: "jwk" }),
        Buffer.from(signature.slice(5), "base64")
      );
    } catch {
      return false;
    }
  });
}
```

### Delivery envelope

Each request wraps the event payload with delivery, app, and installation identity:

```json
{
  "deliveryId": "whd_01...",
  "appId": "app_01...",
  "installationId": "i_01...",
  "event": {
    "id": "evt_01...",
    "type": "pull_request.comment.created",
    "eventTime": "2026-07-01T10:03:00Z",
    "payload": {}
  }
}
```

`deliveryId` is stable across retries. `event.id` identifies the underlying domain event.

### Recovery

Use an app JWT to query [`GET /app/webhook/deliveries`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-webhook-deliveries). Filter by delivery status, event type, installation, time range, or page token. `delivered=false` returns every delivery the receiver has never acknowledged with `2xx`. Deliveries stay listable for seven days, so recover within that window.

Use [`POST /app/webhook/deliveries:batchRedeliver`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#batch-redeliver-webhook-deliveries) to queue redelivery for up to 100 delivery IDs. The operation deduplicates IDs and reports the result for each delivery.

An owner can pause an app's webhook delivery from the app's settings, and Origin can pause it on its own: an app whose receiver fails at least 20 delivery rounds across a 72-hour window, with no successful delivery in that window and failures reaching more than one installer namespace, is disabled automatically. Either way delivery stops until an owner resumes it, redelivery requests return `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400) and nothing is queued, and the API exposes no field for the paused state, so treat a redelivery `FailedPrecondition` as the signal. Clearing the app's `webhookUrl` through [Update App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#update-app) has a stronger effect: it cancels the pending deliveries outright, and setting a URL again does not bring them back.

Every event's payload shape is documented field by field in [Event payloads](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#event-payloads).

The five `installation.*` events go to the app itself rather than to a repository subscription. Origin always sends them, so they do not appear in the app's selectable event list. Every other event in this table is a repository-scoped subscription.

Origin does not deliver `repository.pushed` for a repository it mirrors from GitHub. GitHub owns those pushes and sends its own push webhooks, so an Origin delivery would duplicate them. Pushes to native Origin repositories and to outbound mirrors are delivered as usual, and the mirror state does not affect any other event. `repository.deleted` is delivered for a repository mirrored from GitHub: stopping the sync deletes the Cursor-side repository only, and GitHub sends nothing for it.

### Event payloads

Each event's [envelope](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#delivery-envelope) carries the event's payload object in `payload`. Events that share a shape share a payload family; each family below documents the events that deliver it, its fields, and a sample payload, generated from the [OpenAPI specification](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/openapi.yaml).

### Repository Created

repository.created

    }
  },
  "deletedAt": "2026-08-03T08:15:00Z"
}
```

### Repository Push

repository.pushed

One atomic push, which may update several refs. There is no commits array; each ref update carries best-effort tip metadata only.

#### Payload Fields

`repository` object

The repository the push targeted.

`repository.id` string

`repository.name` string

`repository.owner` object

The owner of a repo.

`repository.owner.slug` string

Unique URL-friendly name of the owner.

`repository.owner.id` string

Unique ID of the owner namespace.

`repository.owner.type` string

`team` or `user`. Output-only; unset when unknown. One of `team`, `user`.

`refUpdates` array

Refs included from this push, capped at 100.

`refUpdates[].ref` string

The full git ref that was pushed. Example: `refs/heads/main` or `refs/tags/v3.14.1`.

`refUpdates[].before` string

The SHA of the most recent commit on `ref` before the push. All-zero (`0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`) when the ref was just created.

`refUpdates[].after` string

The SHA of the most recent commit on `ref` after the push. All-zero (`0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`) when the ref was deleted.

Whether this push created the ref.

`refUpdates[].deleted` boolean

Whether this push deleted the ref.

`refUpdates[].forced` boolean

### Check Run Rerequested

repository.check\_run.rerequested

repository.check\_run.rerequested webhook payload, delivered only to the app that owns the check run. Answer by posting a fresh run for the same head SHA and key — a new run (new external\_id) or an update of the re-requested run. The stamped run reads `status: rerequested` (its conclusion and timings are the superseded result) until the answering post clears `rerequested_at`. Each accepted re-request emits one event, and a run may be re-requested again once answered, so dedupe redeliveries on the event id alone; `check_run.rerequested_at` carries the outstanding stamp. The payload carries no pull request context (check runs attach to `(repository, sha)`): a consumer that needs the pull request resolves it from `check_run.sha` via its own head mapping, or `ListPullRequests` filtered to the head branch it built.
