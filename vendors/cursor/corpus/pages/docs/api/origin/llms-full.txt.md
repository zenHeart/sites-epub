# Origin API

Origin is in Early Beta and subject to change. Review the OpenAPI specification when updating an integration.

Origin is Cursor's code forge. Its public REST API lets apps and tools work with Origin repositories, commits, checks, pull requests, and app installations.

- Origin Apps authenticate with app JWTs and installation access tokens. See [Authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#authentication).
- View the full [OpenAPI specification](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/openapi.yaml) for detailed schemas and examples.
- Agents can load the [llms.txt index](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms.txt) or the complete reference as Markdown at [llms-full.txt](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt).

## Overview

Origin apps implement an OAuth-style installation consent and GitHub App–style authentication model:

1. The app signs a short-lived EdDSA JWT with its Ed25519 private key.
2. The app exchanges that JWT and an installation ID for a short-lived installation access token (`oit_…`).
3. The installation token calls repository APIs and authenticates Git over HTTPS within the installation's approved repositories and scopes.
4. Origin sends signed webhook deliveries to the app's registered webhook URL.

### Base URL

```text
https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin
```

Endpoint paths in the [reference](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#endpoint-reference) include the full `/v1/origin` prefix.

### Protocol conventions

Requests and responses use `application/json`. JSON field names are **camelCase**. Timestamps are RFC 3339 strings. Protobuf 64-bit integers, including pull request numbers and version numbers, are encoded as JSON strings.

Responses carry fields that sit at their default value rather than dropping them, so a `false` boolean, a `0` number, an empty string, and an empty array are all present in the body. Read the value itself instead of treating a missing key as the default. Fields documented as absent or omitted are optional in the contract and stay out of the body when they are unset.

### Preview

Some surface is published in preview. It appears in this reference and the spec, but its shape can change before it's generally available. The [OpenAPI specification](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/openapi.yaml) marks it `x-cursor-visibility: PREVIEW`. The marker can sit on an operation, a parameter, a schema, or a single field, so a stable operation can still return a preview field. Endpoints in preview carry a **Preview** badge in this reference. Treat preview fields as optional and don't build a hard dependency on their shape.

## Getting started

### Origin access

- Browse Origin at [cursor.com/codebase](https://cursor.com/codebase).
- Manage app settings at [cursor.com/codebase/settings/apps](https://cursor.com/codebase/settings/apps).
- [Generate an app signing key](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#generate-an-app-signing-key) and register only the public key.

### Origin CLI

Install the Origin CLI and sign in:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://downloads.cursor.com/origin/install.sh | sh
origin auth login
```

Clone an existing repository:

```bash
origin repo clone '{ownerSlug}/{repoName}'
# or use git directly
git clone 'https://origin.cursor.com/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}.git'
```

Apps clone using [Git HTTPS authentication](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#git-https-authentication) with an installation access token, not a user login.

## Installation

Send a customer workspace admin to:

```text

  &scope=SPACE_SEPARATED_SCOPES
  &redirect_uri=REGISTERED_CALLBACK
  &state=RANDOM_ANTI_FORGERY_VALUE

The workspace admin chooses the target owner, approved scopes, and either all repositories or selected repositories. The customer, not the app, controls repository access.

After approval, Origin redirects to the registered callback:

```text
https://ci.example.com/origin/callback?installation_receipt=RECEIPT_JWT
```

Verify the [installation receipt](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#installation-receipt), then store the installation ID from its `sub` claim. You need it whenever you mint an installation access token.

Installations use one of two repository-selection modes:

- `all`: the installation can access every repository owned by the selected target.
- `selected`: the installation can access only repositories selected by the workspace admin.

Both modes cover mirrored repositories as well as native Origin ones, so a mirror appears in `GET /installation/repos` and can be selected. A mirror is read-only for the installation: see [Mirrored repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#mirrored-repositories).

Use `GET /installation/repos` with an installation token to discover the repositories available to that installation. App JWT endpoints can list, inspect, and delete the app's installations. Deleting an installation prevents new tokens from being minted.

### Installation receipt

`installation_receipt` is a short-lived compact JWT signed by Origin. It proves the installation approval came from Origin rather than a forged redirect and carries everything the callback needs. Cursor refuses to redirect without one, so external callbacks always carry it.

JOSE header:

```json
{
  "alg": "EdDSA",
  "kid": "origin-key-id",
  "typ": "origin-installation-receipt+jwt"
}
```

Claims:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin",
  "aud": "app_01...",
  "sub": "i_01...",
  "namespace_id": "ns_01...",
  "iat": 1786465200,
  "exp": 1786465500,
  "jti": "RECEIPT_UUID",
  "installedBy": {
    "id": "user_01...",
    "email": "installer@example.com",
    "displayName": "Jane Doe"
  },
  "state": "ORIGINAL_VALUE"
}
```

- `aud` is your app ID and `sub` is the installation ID to use when minting installation access tokens.
- `namespace_id` is the stable ID of the namespace the app was installed into.
- `installedBy` identifies the user who performed this install or re-consent. It describes the current action, so on a re-consent it can differ from the durable `installedBy` on [Get App Installation](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-app-installation). It carries `displayName` when the account has a name, and never carries `handle`; read the handle from a REST response or a webhook payload instead.
- Receipts expire five minutes after issuance. `jti` is unique per receipt.
- `state` is present only when the install URL carried a non-empty `state`, and echoes that value. Match it against the anti-forgery value you generated before redirecting.

Verify the receipt before trusting the callback: resolve the signing key from the [JWKS](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#discovery-and-signing-keys) by the `kid` header, require `alg` `EdDSA` and `typ` `origin-installation-receipt+jwt`, and validate the signature, `iss`, `aud`, and `exp`. Reject the callback when verification fails.

The receipt is not an installation access token. Never send it as a Bearer credential; mint installation tokens through [Create Installation Access Token](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-installation-access-token) instead.

## Authentication

Send REST credentials with the Bearer scheme. Each endpoint's **Auth** badges list the credential types it accepts:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $ORIGIN_BEARER_TOKEN"
```

Cursor API keys are not Origin Bearer tokens. For user-authenticated requests, use the [Origin CLI](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#user-authenticated-cli-requests), which exchanges a personal user API key for the short-lived access token that Origin accepts. Do not put a Cursor API key directly in the `Authorization` header.

### Generate an app signing key

Origin Apps authenticate with an Ed25519 key pair. Generate the pair locally, then register only the public key at [cursor.com/codebase/settings/apps](https://cursor.com/codebase/settings/apps). An app can hold up to 10 active signing keys.

The private key must stay secret. Do not upload it, paste it into app settings, commit it to a repository, or share it. Store it in a secrets manager. Cursor stores only the public key.

Create a PKCS#8 private key and a PEM SPKI public key with OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm ED25519 -out origin-app-private.pem
openssl pkey -in origin-app-private.pem -pubout -out origin-app-public.pem
```

The public key file starts with `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`. Paste that PEM when you add a signing key. Use the matching private key only to [sign app JWTs](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#app-jwt).

### App JWT

Sign a short-lived JWT with the Ed25519 private key paired with one of the app's active signing keys. Generate that pair as described in [Generate an app signing key](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#generate-an-app-signing-key).

JOSE header:

```json
{
  "alg": "EdDSA",
  "kid": "app_01...",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

Claims:

```json
{
  "iss": "app_01...",
  "aud": "origin-apps",
  "iat": 1782928800,
  "exp": 1782929100
}
```

Set `iss` and `kid` to the app ID. Use a lifetime of approximately five minutes.

```text
Authorization: Bearer APP_JWT
```

Use an app JWT for app-level operations such as reading app metadata, managing installations, minting installation tokens, and recovering webhook deliveries.

### Installation access token

Call [`POST /app/installations/{installationId}/access_tokens`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-installation-access-token) with an app JWT. Installation tokens begin with `oit_`.

```text
Authorization: Bearer oit_...
```

The response includes `expiresAt`. Mint tokens just in time, refresh them before expiration, treat them like passwords, and never log them.

A token expires at most 15 minutes after creation, and never later than the app JWT that requested it, so the five-minute JWT recommended above yields a token of at most five minutes. Read `expiresAt` and mint a new token when it passes rather than assuming a duration: Origin tokens are shorter-lived than GitHub App installation tokens, and an integration that reuses a token on GitHub's schedule fails once the token expires. Sign the JWT with a later `exp` when a job needs the full 15 minutes, as the [CloneKit CI recipe](https://cursor.com/docs/origin/clonekit-ci.md#mint-a-token-in-the-job) does.

Removing the installation, or deleting the app, invalidates its installation tokens before `expiresAt`. The REST API and Git over HTTPS then reject the token with `401`. Do not retry with the same token; the app must be reinstalled before it can mint a working one.

An installation token cannot exceed the installation's approved scopes or repository access. You can attenuate a token to fewer `scopes` or `repositoryIds`. Empty or omitted arrays inherit the complete installation grant.

Use installation tokens for repository-scoped operations, including pull requests, check-run writes, and [Git over HTTPS](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#git-https-authentication).

To act as a member of the installation's namespace instead of as the app, mint an installation user token. See [Acting on behalf of users](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/acting-as-users.md).

### Git HTTPS authentication

Installation access tokens authenticate Git over HTTPS. The Git endpoint uses HTTP Basic authentication: the password is the installation token, and the username is `x-access-token`. Bearer credentials belong on the REST API; Git HTTPS rejects them.

Mint a token from [Create Installation Access Token](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-installation-access-token) immediately before the Git operation. Tokens expire after at most 15 minutes.

Clone, fetch, and pull require [`repository:contents:read`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#scopes). Push requires [`repository:contents:write`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#scopes). The token must include the target repository in its grant.

Pushing also requires the repository's owner to be eligible to write to Origin, the same requirement [Create Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-repo) carries. A user owner must be on a Pro, Pro Student, Pro+, Ultra, or Start plan. A team owner must have an active paid team plan, must not be on Privacy Mode (Legacy), and must not have Origin turned off by a team admin. A push to a repository whose owner is ineligible returns `403`. Clone, fetch, and pull do not carry this requirement.

Read `cloneUrl` from [Get Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-repo) or [List App Installation Repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-app-installation-repositories). Both the GitHub-shaped path (`https://origin.cursor.com/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME.git`) and the legacy `/git/` path clone.

```bash
git clone "https://x-access-token:${INSTALLATION_TOKEN}@origin.cursor.com/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME.git"
```

Embedding the token in the URL stores it in `.git/config`. After a successful clone, rewrite the remote so later commands do not reuse an expired secret:

```bash
git remote set-url origin "https://origin.cursor.com/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME.git"
```

To keep the token out of the remote URL, supply it through Git's credential helper:

```bash
git -c credential.helper="!f() { echo username=x-access-token; echo password=${INSTALLATION_TOKEN}; }; f" \
  clone "https://origin.cursor.com/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME.git"
```

The Origin CLI credential helper is for user logins. App integrations pass the installation token as shown here. Treat the token like a password, never log it, and mint a fresh one before `expiresAt` when a job still needs Git access.

Git over HTTPS meters its own budget, separate from the REST budget in [Rate limits](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#rate-limits). A charged Git response carries the same `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Used` headers, with `X-RateLimit-Resource` set to `git` rather than `core`. Over-budget Git requests return `429` with `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-Reset`. Read the headers to pace a job rather than assuming a number; unmetered requests carry no rate-limit headers.

On a mirrored repository, an installation token clones, fetches, and pulls, and Origin rejects `git push` with `403`. See [Mirrored repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#mirrored-repositories).

### User-authenticated CLI requests

Use `origin api` for user-authenticated requests. For an interactive session, sign in through your browser:

```bash
origin auth login
origin api /repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls
```

For a non-interactive session, provide a personal user API key from [Cursor Dashboard → API Keys](https://cursor.com/dashboard/api):

```bash
export CURSOR_API_KEY="YOUR_PERSONAL_USER_API_KEY"
origin api /repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls
```

The CLI exchanges the personal API key for a short-lived user access token, then sends that token in the `Authorization` header. Do not send the API key itself to an Origin endpoint. App integrations should use app JWTs and installation access tokens instead.

### Discovery and signing keys

Origin publishes unauthenticated discovery metadata and its active signing keys. The same keys sign webhook deliveries and [installation receipts](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#installation-receipt).

Discovery metadata identifies the issuer and `jwks_uri`:

```bash
curl https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

```json
{
  "issuer": "https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin",
  "jwks_uri": "https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/keys",
  "response_types_supported": ["id_token"],
  "subject_types_supported": ["public"],
  "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": ["EdDSA"]
}
```

`/keys` returns active Ed25519 JWKs:

```bash
curl https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/keys
```

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "OKP",
      "crv": "Ed25519",
      "use": "sig",
      "alg": "EdDSA",
      "kid": "origin-key-id",
      "x": "PUBLIC_KEY_MATERIAL"
    }
  ]
}
```

Cache the JWKS. `/keys` sends `Cache-Control: public, max-age=600, stale-if-error=600`, so reuse a cached response for 10 minutes, then refresh; if a refresh fails, keep the last good keys for at most another 10 minutes before failing verification. Also refresh on a signature that no key verifies, which drops a retired key ID. Keys rotate weekly.

Webhook signatures do not carry a key ID, so verification should try each active Ed25519 key. Installation receipts carry the signing key's `kid` in their JOSE header, so receipt verification can resolve the key directly.

## Scopes

Request only the minimum scopes your app needs. `repository:metadata:read` and app or installation metadata access are granted automatically and should not be added separately to installation URLs.

| Scope                                    | Allows                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Add, update, remove, and replace inbound IP allowlist entries and set whether the namespace enforces its allowlist. The certificate authority and allowlist writes are carried by a Cursor user credential. |
| `namespace:user_tokens:write`            | Mint installation user tokens that act as a member of the installation's namespace. A token can't carry this scope. See [Acting on behalf of users](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/acting-as-users.md).                                                                                                                                   |

Requesting a `:write` scope also grants the matching `:read` scope, so `repository:labels:write` covers `repository:labels:read` and you do not have to list both. The reverse does not hold: a read scope never grants writes.

The installation token can only narrow these grants. It cannot add a scope or repository the workspace admin did not approve.

Mirror-state changes sit outside this table. [Transition Repo Mirror](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/migrations.md#transition-repo-mirror) and [Detach Repo Mirror](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/migrations.md#detach-repo-mirror) take `repository:mirror:write` or `repository:mirror:delete`, which an app cannot request at installation: they are carried by a Cursor user credential, and the caller must also administer the repository on the mirror's upstream source. [Get Mirror Transition Job](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/migrations.md#get-mirror-transition-job) and [Get Active Mirror Transition Job](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/migrations.md#get-active-mirror-transition-job), which read those transitions, take `repository:mirror:read` on the same credential.

Installation management sits outside it too. [Add App Installation Repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#add-app-installation-repositories) takes `namespace:installations:write`, which an app cannot request at installation: a namespace admin holds it on a Cursor user credential, and the same credential kind that consented to the installation is the one that can extend it.

App management sits outside it for the same reason. [Create App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-app) takes `namespace:apps:create`, [List Namespace Apps](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-namespace-apps) and [Get App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-app) take `namespace:apps:read`, and [Update App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#update-app), [Add App Signing Key](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#add-app-signing-key), and [Revoke App Signing Key](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#revoke-app-signing-key) take `app:settings:write`. A publisher holds these on a Cursor user credential; an app cannot request them for itself.

The table covers the scopes an app requests at installation. To look up the scope a single operation requires, read its `x-origin-scopes` extension in the [OpenAPI specification](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/openapi.yaml). That extension covers every operation, including the `app`, `installation`, and `namespace` scopes that come with the credential itself rather than from an installation grant. An operation whose scopes all come with the credential marks its extension `ambient: true`: there is nothing to request for it, and presenting the right credential is enough.

### Mirrored repositories

An installation uses every scope it holds on a native Origin repository. On a mirrored repository, only five scopes apply:

- `repository:metadata:read`
- `repository:members:read`
- `repository:contents:read`
- `repository:mirror:read`
- `repository:mirror:sync`

Every other scope returns `403` on that repository, whatever the workspace admin approved. Over the REST API, repository and contents reads, commit comparison, and [Sync Mirror](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#sync-mirror) keep working, and Origin rejects pull requests, reviews, comments, checks, rulesets, and every write. Over Git HTTPS, clone, fetch, pull, and LFS download keep working, and Origin rejects push and LFS upload.

Changing a repository's mirror state is a user-credential operation rather than something an installation can do: [Transition Repo Mirror](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/migrations.md#transition-repo-mirror) retries a mirror whose initial sync failed, and [Detach Repo Mirror](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/migrations.md#detach-repo-mirror) disconnects the mirror for good, leaving a native repository.

Treat the `403` as authoritative rather than deciding from `mirror.status` whether writes are allowed.

## Rate limits

The Origin API uses a shared per-principal point budget that resets on a rolling one-minute window. Each authenticated principal kind has its own budget:

| Principal                      | Default budget      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Installation access token      | 3,000 points/minute |
| App JWT                        | 6,000 points/minute |
| Cursor user or service account | 600 points/minute   |

Every endpoint charges a fixed cost against that budget before the handler runs. Authentication and authorization failures are not charged.

| Cost | Operations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Cursor can raise per-app minute budgets for design partners. Contact Cursor if your integration needs a higher limit.

### Response headers

Charged responses and [Get Rate Limit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-rate-limit) include:

| Header                  | Description                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | Points available in the current window for this principal |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Points left in the current window                         |
| `X-RateLimit-Used`      | Points consumed in the current window                     |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | Unix timestamp (UTC seconds) when the window resets       |
| `X-RateLimit-Resource`  | Always `core` for the shared public API budget            |

`X-RateLimit-Reset` advertises a full 60-second window from the response time. The counter's window starts at the first charged request in a burst, not on a calendar-minute boundary.

### Exceeding the limit

When a request would exceed the budget, the API returns HTTP `429` with:

- `Retry-After`: seconds to wait before retrying (`60`)
- The same `X-RateLimit-*` headers, with `X-RateLimit-Remaining` set to `0`

```json
{
  "code": 8,
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded: 3000 points per minute for this installation. Retry after 60s.",
  "details": []
}
```

Wait for `Retry-After`, or until `X-RateLimit-Reset`, before retrying. Use backoff with jitter when concurrent callers share one installation token.

### Checking remaining quota

Call [Get Rate Limit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-rate-limit) to read the current budget without consuming points. The response body mirrors the `X-RateLimit-*` headers for the shared `core` resource.

## Common conventions

### Pagination

Paginated endpoints accept:

- `pageSize`: defaults to 30 and is capped at 100.
- `pageToken`: opaque token returned by the preceding page. Do not inspect or construct it.

Responses use a resource-specific collection field and `nextPageToken`. It is empty when no next page exists. Public list responses do not include total counts. Page tokens are bound to their originating resource and filters. Restart pagination when filters change. Invalid or mismatched non-empty tokens return `400`.

Send the same `pageSize` on every request in a sequence, continuations included. Most list endpoints apply a `pageSize` sent with a page token to that page and keep the previous page size when it is omitted; their `pageToken` entries say so. The rest differ in what a page token remembers, so a constant `pageSize` gets the same page size from every endpoint.

### Errors

Errors use a Google RPC-style body:

```json
{
  "code": 5,
  "message": "resource not found",
  "details": []
}
```

Common HTTP statuses are `400`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `429`, `500`, and `503`. Some Git-database operations also return `409` for repository-state conflicts. See [Rate limits](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#rate-limits) for `429` headers and retry behavior.

Use the HTTP status and `code` to branch on errors. Treat `message` as developer-facing text.

A `404` never distinguishes a resource that does not exist from one your app cannot reach. Read it as "not available to this installation" rather than as proof the resource is absent.

`details` carries typed entries: `google.rpc.BadRequest` field violations on an invalid argument, and a `google.rpc.RequestInfo` entry on every error. Origin can add detail types at any time, so ignore entries your integration does not recognize.

Every error response carries the request ID twice: in an `X-Request-ID` response header, and as a `google.rpc.RequestInfo` entry in `details`. Origin echoes the `x-request-id` you sent, or generates one when you send none. The `RequestInfo` entry is present even when `message` is an opaque internal error, so quote the request ID when you contact Cursor about a failed call.

Unmatched paths under `/v1/origin`, and requests that use the wrong method on a known path, return this same body rather than a generic router error. The message names the method and path and never echoes the query string.

### IDs

Resource IDs are opaque strings with a type prefix, such as `app_…` for an app and `i_…` for an installation. Store and compare them as whole strings. Don't parse them, derive meaning from their characters, or rely on their sort order.

An ID stays the same for the life of its resource, while names and slugs can change. A repository keeps its ID across a rename, so key cached data on the ID rather than on `{ownerSlug}/{repoName}`, and address the repository by ID as described in [Repository paths](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#repository-paths).

### Repository paths

Repository-scoped paths take the owner slug and repository name as `{ownerSlug}/{repoName}`. Both segments resolve case-insensitively, so any casing addresses the repository. Responses return the stored name and slug rather than the casing you sent, and Git HTTPS URLs resolve the same way. Compare repository names case-insensitively, and read the canonical casing from [Get Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-repo).

Every repository-scoped path also accepts the repository's stable ID in place of the pair: send `_` as the owner slug and the ID as the repository name, as in `GET /v1/origin/repos/_/REPO_ID`. Read the ID from the `id` field on [Get Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-repo). The sentinel `_` cannot be claimed as an owner slug, so the two forms never collide. In a Connect or JSON request, set `ownerSlug` to `_` and `name` to the ID.

The ID form survives a rename, which makes it the stable way to address a repository. It grants nothing on its own: after Origin resolves the ID to a repository, your app still needs the same scope on that repository. An ID your app cannot reach returns the same `404` body as an ID that does not exist, so a response never confirms that a repository exists. A malformed ID returns `400`. [Create Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-repo) takes an owner slug alone and rejects `_`.

### Resource references

Resource snapshots contain the resource's current fields. Container context uses compact references instead of duplicating complete resources:

- `RepositoryReference` identifies a repository.
- `PullRequestReference` identifies a pull request and nests its repository reference.
- `ThreadReference` identifies the thread containing a pull request comment.
- `OriginActor` identifies a public actor as one of `user`, `app`, or `serviceAccount`. Exactly one variant is present; read the identity from that variant. A `user` can carry `performedVia`, naming the app (`performedVia.app`) or the service account (`performedVia.serviceAccount`), such as the user's personal Grok bot, that acted on the user's behalf; the user is still the actor. See [Acting on behalf of users](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/acting-as-users.md). A `serviceAccount`, including one in `performedVia`, carries its `id` and, when Cursor can describe the account, a `type` naming the product it acts for and a `displayName`.

A `user` actor's `email` is member information. In pull request, review, comment, check run, requested reviewer, and merge eligibility responses, it's an empty string unless the caller holds `repository:members:read` on the repository. Every other response and webhook payload that carries a `user` includes it.

An actor field is absent when the user or service account it names has been deleted, and requested-reviewer lists leave out a deleted reviewer. A deleted service account named in `performedVia` still appears with its `id` alone.

## Check runs

Apps report CI results as check suites and check runs against a commit through [Post Check Run](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#post-check-run) and [Batch Upsert Check Runs](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#batch-upsert-check-runs), and read them back through the [Checks](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#checks) endpoints. This section defines the terms those endpoints share: which attempt is current, how Origin orders and reports writes, and how timestamps and deadlines behave.

### Attempts and the current attempt

Each `(actor, key, externalId, baseSha)` reported against a commit is one suite attempt, and each `(suite, key, externalId)` within it is one run attempt. A post without `baseSha` addresses the base-agnostic attempt, so the same `externalId` posted against a second base, or with and without a base, starts a separate attempt. Reusing an `externalId` with the same base updates that attempt in place; a new `externalId` starts a new attempt and keeps the earlier one as history. Superseded attempts stay readable by id through [Get Check Suite](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-check-suite) and [Get Check Run](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-check-run).

Where the API shows a commit's current checks, in [List Check Suites For Commit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-check-suites-for-commit), [List Check Runs For Commit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-check-runs-for-commit), and the pull request's CI state and required checks, Origin collapses attempts in two steps:

1. The current suite attempt per `(actor, key)` is the one whose current runs, as the second step picks them, carry the newest `externalUpdatedAt`; a suite with no runs ranks by its `createdAt`. Ties break by the suite's `createdAt`, then its `id`, newest first.
2. Within that suite attempt, the current run for a `key` is the one with the newest `externalUpdatedAt`. Ties break by `createdAt`, then `id`, newest first.

In the commit listings, attempts reported against different `baseSha` values compete in the same collapse for their `(actor, key)`.

[List Check Runs For Suite](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-check-runs-for-suite) applies the second step to the suite you name. A run is current for its commit only when its suite is the commit's current suite attempt. Because the first step ranks whole suite attempts, a run posted under a superseded suite attempt stays out of the commit's checks while another attempt holds a newer `externalUpdatedAt`; once its timestamp is the newest, its suite attempt becomes current and the other attempt's runs are hidden instead.

A cancelled attempt does not displace a passing one. At either step, a cancelled attempt ranks below the other attempts of its `key` when the newest attempt of that `key` that was not cancelled passed. A run passed when it is `completed` with the conclusion `success`, `neutral`, or `skipped`. A suite attempt passed when all its current runs passed, and it counts as cancelled when its current runs are all `completed`, at least one with the conclusion `cancelled` and the rest passing. When a re-run of the passing attempt is requested, cancelled attempts whose `externalUpdatedAt` is at or after the request rank by their timestamps again. A newer cancelled suite attempt still displaces an older one that did not fully pass.

A run whose re-run was requested keeps its place as the current attempt for its `key` and reads as pending until the owning app answers: see [Rerequest Check Run](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#rerequest-check-run).

### Ordering writes

Origin orders posts to one run, the same `externalId` and `key` in the suite, by `checkRun.externalUpdatedAt` at millisecond precision. A post applies only when its value is at or after the run's stored `externalUpdatedAt`, raised to `rerequestedAt` while a re-request is outstanding. Equal values apply, so the later post wins, with two exceptions that are also treated as stale: a `queued`, `in_progress`, or `failing` post cannot reopen a `completed` run at the same timestamp, and a post at exactly the stored timestamp is ignored while `rerequestedAt` is set. A newer value applies, including reopening a `completed` run, with one exception that is treated as stale whatever its timestamp: a `completed` post with the conclusion `cancelled` cannot replace a `completed` run whose conclusion is `success`, `neutral`, or `skipped`.

A stale post still succeeds. The response is HTTP `200` with the stored suite and run, not the posted values, and the run's `updatedAt` does not move. Each posted run comes back as a pair: `checkRun`, the stored run after the call, and `outcome`, what the write did to it. [Post Check Run](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#post-check-run) returns the pair at the top level of its response, next to `checkSuite`. [Batch Upsert Check Runs](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#batch-upsert-check-runs) returns one pair per posted run in `results[]`, in request order, so a batch element carries the same per-run result the single call inlines. Read `outcome`, or each `results[].outcome`, to learn what the write did:

| `outcome`       | Meaning                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `created`       | No run existed for `(externalId, key)` in the suite; one was created.                       |
| `updated`       | An existing run was replaced with the posted values.                                        |
| `unchanged`     | The posted values, `externalUpdatedAt` included, equal the stored run; nothing was written. |
| `ignored_stale` | The post was ignored as stale; `checkRun` carries the stored run, not the posted values.    |

`updatedAt` does not advance on an `unchanged` or `ignored_stale` post, so it cannot tell the two apart; only `outcome` can. Treat an unrecognized value as "the stored run is in the response; whether it was written is unknown". In a batch, Origin applies the rule to each run separately: a stale run does not fail the batch, and `results[]` carries the stored run in that run's slot with `outcome` `ignored_stale`.

On Batch Upsert Check Runs, the top-level `checkRuns[]` is deprecated in favor of `results[]`. It is still populated with the same stored runs, in the same order, but it carries no outcomes; read `results[]` instead. This applies to the batch only: on Post Check Run, `checkRun` and `outcome` are the top-level fields to read.

### Timestamps and deadlines

A post whose `externalUpdatedAt`, `startedAt`, or `completedAt` is more than 60 seconds in the future returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). `completedAt` must not precede `startedAt` when both are in the same post. `deadlineAt` must not be more than 24 hours in the future.

Only a running run, `in_progress` or `failing`, expires. Once its `deadlineAt` has passed, a periodic sweep completes it with the conclusion `timed_out`, sets `completedAt` if the run had none, and delivers [`repository.check_run.completed`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events). Like every completed run, a timed-out run reads with no `deadlineAt`. Expiry lands some minutes after the deadline rather than at it: the sweep runs about every 30 minutes by default, an operational setting that can change, so do not depend on the interval. A `queued` run never expires, and neither does a run with no `deadlineAt`. A `completed` post clears the deadline. Origin leaves `externalUpdatedAt` untouched when it times a run out, so a later post with a newer `externalUpdatedAt` still applies to a timed-out run. A timed-out run keeps its expired deadline until a re-request or a `completed` post clears it. A post that reopens it without its own `deadlineAt` before then gets the expired deadline back, so once the run is `in_progress` or `failing`, the next sweep times it out again. To keep the run open, send a new `deadlineAt` with that post.

## Current limitations

- Namespace-wide repository listing and repository creation are not part of the partner API. Discover repositories through the installation.
- Commit comparison returns summary data rather than an embedded commit list. Changed files have their own paginated endpoint, [List Comparison Files](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-comparison-files).
- Threads are addressable only for resolution. There is no endpoint that lists threads directly; read them from the comments they contain.
- Push webhooks do not include a complete commit list.
- Pull request merge supports native Origin repositories. Mirrored repositories are rejected.
- A mirrored repository is read-only for an installation. See [Mirrored repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#mirrored-repositories).

## Implementation checklist

- Store the Ed25519 private key in a secrets manager and rotate keys deliberately. See [Generate an app signing key](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#generate-an-app-signing-key).
- Verify the [installation receipt](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#installation-receipt) on install callbacks and read the installation ID and `state` from its claims.
- Use short-lived app JWTs and mint installation tokens just in time.
- Use installation tokens, not app JWTs, for repository-scoped APIs, check-run writes, and Git HTTPS.
- Request the minimum scopes and repository access.
- Treat page tokens as opaque and restart pagination when filters change.
- Keep check `key` values stable and readable. Use a new immutable `externalId` for each retry and increasing `externalUpdatedAt` values for updates.
- Read `outcome` on every Post Check Run response, and each `results[].outcome` on every Batch Upsert Check Runs response; a stale post returns `200` with the stored run. See [Check runs](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#check-runs).
- Verify webhook signatures against the raw request body before parsing.
- Deduplicate deliveries with `webhook-id` and process asynchronously after returning `2xx`.
- Ignore unknown JSON fields for forward compatibility.
- Honor `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-*` headers. Use [Get Rate Limit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-rate-limit) to monitor remaining points without consuming them.

## Endpoint reference

Download the [OpenAPI specification](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/openapi.yaml) for the complete component schemas. The document declares `https://api.cursor.com` as its server and a `bearerAuth` HTTP bearer security scheme, and each operation lists the response codes that operation can return, plus a request and response example. Every operation also carries an `x-origin-scopes` extension: `scopes` holds the scope the operation requires, and `tokenTypes` holds the credential kinds it accepts. Each webhook payload schema carries an `x-origin-webhook-events` extension listing the [events](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#event-payloads) that deliver it, and [preview](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#preview) surface carries `x-cursor-visibility: PREVIEW`. Path parameters carry the same names the URLs use, `ownerSlug` and `repoName`. Every operation carries a unique `operationId`; where one operation answers two URL shapes, the second shape's id takes a `_2` suffix, as in `OriginService_GetRepoTarball_2`.

The JSON snippets show schema-shaped placeholder values. Response field descriptions reflect the OpenAPI schema and current platform contract.

### Delete App Installation

DELETE

`/v1/origin/app/installations/{installationId}`

Requires no scope (app JWT).

Deletes an installation that belongs to the authenticated app and prevents new installation tokens from being minted. Already-issued short-lived tokens may remain valid until they expire (at most 15 minutes). The response body is empty.

#### Path Parameters

`installationId` string Required

The unique identifier of the installation to delete. Bound from the URL path; the installation must belong to the authenticated app.

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/app/installations/INSTALLATION_ID' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

### Create Installation Access Token

POST

`/v1/origin/app/installations/{installationId}/access_tokens`

Requires no scope (app JWT).

Creates an installation access token for the authenticated app.

Requires app signing-JWT authentication, like GetAuthenticatedApp. The token is scoped to the named installation, which must belong to the authenticated app. Callers may attenuate the token to a subset of the installation's accepted scopes and accessible repositories.

`repositoryIds` can name a mirrored repository. The resulting token carries the installation's scopes, and Origin still applies the mirror ceiling on each request: see [Mirrored repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#mirrored-repositories).

#### Path Parameters

`installationId` string Required

The unique identifier of the installation to scope the token to. Bound from the URL path; the installation must belong to the authenticated app.

#### Request Body

`scopes` array

Scope strings to grant the token. Values must be unique and included in the installation's accepted scopes. Empty or omitted inherits the full scope grant.

`repositoryIds` array

Repository IDs to grant the token. Values must be unique, accessible to the installation, and contain at most 50 entries. Empty or omitted inherits all accessible repositories.

#### Response Fields

`token` string

Short-lived installation credential with the oit\_ prefix.

`expiresAt` string

RFC 3339 expiration time; the token expires after at most 15 minutes and never outlives the app JWT used to mint it.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/app/installations/INSTALLATION_ID/access_tokens' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "scopes": [
    "repository:contents:read",
    "repository:pull_requests:read"
  ],
  "repositoryIds": [
    "repo_01k2ja2000e0080000000000q4"
  ]
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "token": "oit_2v8xkq4m1c7p9t3w5y0z6r4b",
  "expiresAt": "2026-08-01T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Create Installation User Token

POST

`/v1/origin/app/installations/{installationId}/user_access_tokens`

Requires no scope (app JWT).

Creates an installation user token that acts on behalf of one member of the installation's namespace.

The installation must belong to the authenticated app and have accepted `namespace:user_tokens:write`. Name the user with exactly one of `userId` or `userEmail`. An unknown, ambiguous, or ineligible user receives `PermissionDenied` (HTTP 403) without revealing which condition failed.

The token's access is limited to permissions held by both the installation and the user. When both `scopes` and `repositoryIds` are set, each scope must be allowed on every listed repository for both principals or the request receives `PermissionDenied` (HTTP 403). See [Acting on behalf of users](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/acting-as-users.md) for the complete flow.

#### Path Parameters

`installationId` string Required

The unique identifier of the installation to scope the token to. Bound from the URL path; the installation must belong to the authenticated app.

#### Request Body

`userId` string

The user's `user_…` ID, as returned in actor payloads. Set exactly one of `userId` or `userEmail`.

`userEmail` string

The user's account email. It must match exactly one eligible namespace member.

`scopes` array

Scope strings that cap the token. Values must be unique and included in the installation's accepted scopes. Requesting `namespace:user_tokens:write` returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400); it authorizes minting and cannot be delegated to the token. Empty or omitted adds no scope cap.

`repositoryIds` array

Repository IDs that cap the token. Values must be unique, accessible to the installation, and contain at most 50 entries. Empty or omitted adds no repository cap.

#### Response Fields

`token` string

Short-lived installation user token. Treat it as a secret and do not log it.

`expiresAt` string

RFC 3339 expiration time; the token expires after at most 15 minutes and never outlives the app JWT used to mint it.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/app/installations/INSTALLATION_ID/user_access_tokens' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "userId": "user_01k2ja2000e0080000000000c3",
  "scopes": [
    "repository:pull_requests:reviews:write"
  ],
  "repositoryIds": [
    "repo_01k2ja2000e0080000000000q4"
  ]
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "token": "YOUR_INSTALLATION_USER_TOKEN",
  "expiresAt": "2026-08-01T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### List App Installation Repositories

GET

`/v1/origin/installation/repos`

Requires no scope (installation access token).

Lists repositories accessible to the authenticated app installation.

Requires an installation access token (`oit_`) minted by CreateInstallationAccessToken.

Partners discover their repositories through this endpoint. List entries are sparse repository summaries; use [Get Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-repo) for full timestamps. [Get Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-repo) includes the output-only `cloneUrl`.

Results include mirrored repositories, which are read-only for an installation: see [Mirrored repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#mirrored-repositories).

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Max repositories to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page. The same filter must be used when requesting subsequent pages. `pageSize` on a follow-up request applies to that page; omit it to keep the previous page size.

`filter` string

Optional case-insensitive substring filter applied to repository names and owner namespaces. A single-slash `owner/repo` value matches each half against its corresponding field. Leading and trailing whitespace is ignored; an empty value applies no filter.

#### Response Fields

Sparse repository summaries; use get-repository for full timestamps.

`repositories[].id` string

Origin repository identifier.

`repositories[].name` string

Repository name within its owner.

`repositories[].fullName` string

Combined owner and repository name, such as acme/api.

`repositories[].owner` object

Mirror metadata. Absent for a native repository and before a mirror's initial sync is ready.

`repositories[].mirror.source` string

Mirror source. Allowed value: `github`.

`repositories[].mirror.sourceId` string

Opaque repository identifier assigned by the source.

`repositories[].mirror.status` string

Effective mirror direction during a transition, until cutover completes. Allowed values: `inbound`.

Opaque cursor for the next page; empty when there are no more pages.

`repoSelectionMode` string

Reports whether the installation grants all repositories or only selected repositories.

```bash
curl --request GET \

    }
  ],
  "repoSelectionMode": "selected"
}
```

### List Webhook Deliveries

GET

`/v1/origin/app/webhook/deliveries`

Requires no scope (app JWT).

Lists webhook deliveries for the authenticated app, newest first.

A delivery is one event owed to one app; its id is the `webhook-id` header value the receiver sees. `delivered=false` is the recovery predicate: it selects every delivery that has never received a `2xx`, including deliveries whose retry ladder ran out during an outage.

Deliveries are listable for seven days after they are created, and only while your app has an active installation in the delivery's namespace. App-targeted lifecycle events such as `installation.deleted` stay visible after the uninstall they describe.

#### Query Parameters

`delivered` boolean

Compares against `delivered_at`. `delivered=false` is the recovery predicate: it is evaluated server-side, so it cannot miss a delivery whose retry ladder exhausted mid-outage the way a caller-supplied time window silently does.

`eventType` string

Exact event type, e.g. `pull_request.created`.

`installationId` string

Narrow to one installation (`WebhookDelivery.installation.id`).

`createdAfter` string

Bound the delivery's creation time. For browsing, not for recovery.

`createdBefore` string

`pageSize` integer

Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page.

#### Response Fields

`deliveries` array

Webhook deliveries for the authenticated app, ordered newest first. Each delivery ID is the webhook-id seen by the receiver.

`deliveries[].id` string

Stable delivery identifier and the `webhook-id` value the receiver sees; use it as the idempotency key.

`deliveries[].event` object

The event this delivery carries.

`deliveries[].event.id` string

Underlying Origin event identifier. It may also be present alongside the stable delivery ID but is not the idempotency key.

`deliveries[].event.type` string

Event slug carried by the delivery for routing.

`deliveries[].installation` object

The installation this delivery belongs to. `id` is the current active installation for the target owner; unset when none exists (possible only for app-targeted lifecycle events after an uninstall).

`deliveries[].installation.id` string

Installation identifier associated with a webhook delivery list item.

`deliveries[].installation.target` object

Owner targeted by the installation.

`deliveries[].installation.target.slug` string

URL-facing owner slug used with the owner ID to identify the repository owner.

`deliveries[].installation.target.id` string

Origin owner identifier.

`deliveries[].installation.target.type` string

Owner namespace type. Output-only. Allowed values: `team`, `user`. Omitted when unknown.

`deliveries[].createdAt` string

Delivery creation timestamp used by createdAfter and createdBefore browsing filters.

`deliveries[].deliveredAt` string

Absence corresponds to delivered=false: the receiver has never acknowledged this delivery with a 2xx response.

`deliveries[].lastAttempt` object

The most recent HTTP attempt, when one exists: its response status code, latency, transport error, trigger, and time.

`deliveries[].lastAttempt.id` string

Webhook delivery attempt identifier.

`deliveries[].lastAttempt.deliveryId` string

Stable delivery identifier associated with this attempt.

`deliveries[].lastAttempt.trigger` string

Reason this delivery attempt was sent. Allowed values: `automatic`, `manual`.

`deliveries[].lastAttempt.responseStatusCode` integer

Unset when the POST produced no HTTP response (transport error, timeout).

`deliveries[].lastAttempt.latencyMs` integer

Delivery attempt latency in milliseconds.

`deliveries[].lastAttempt.errorMessage` string

Transport error detail when there was no HTTP response; empty otherwise.

`deliveries[].lastAttempt.attemptedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for this delivery attempt.

`nextPageToken` string

Opaque cursor for the next page; empty when there are no more pages.

### Batch Redeliver Webhook Deliveries

POST

`/v1/origin/app/webhook/deliveries:batchRedeliver`

Requires no scope (app JWT).

Asks Origin to send deliveries again.

The request means "ensure a send is in flight for each of these", not "add another send". It returns one result per unique input rather than failing the batch on a bad entry, so a single expired ID cannot block the rest of a recovery page. A `202` means the sends are queued; delivery itself is asynchronous, so poll [List Webhook Deliveries](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-webhook-deliveries) for outcomes.

#### Request Body

`deliveryIds` array Required

Deliveries to send again. At most 100 unique entries, matching the `pageSize` ceiling on [List Webhook Deliveries](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-webhook-deliveries). Duplicates are removed, keeping first-seen order. An empty list, or more than 100 unique entries, returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Response Fields

`results` array

Accepted asynchronous redelivery results, one per unique delivery ID, with queued, already\_in\_flight, or not\_found outcomes.

`results[].deliveryId` string

Requested stable delivery ID corresponding to this batch result.

`results[].outcome` string

Redelivery disposition: `queued` when a send was created, `already_in_flight` when a send was already running, and `not_found` otherwise. `already_in_flight` is a success, not an error. `not_found` covers unknown IDs, IDs older than the seven-day retention window, and namespaces where your app is no longer installed.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/app/webhook/deliveries:batchRedeliver' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "deliveryIds": [
    "whd_01k2ja2000e0080000000000j9"
  ]
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "deliveryId": "whd_01k2ja2000e0080000000000j9",
      "outcome": "queued"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Ping Webhook

POST

`/v1/origin/app/webhook/pings`

Requires no scope (app JWT).

Sends a test delivery to the authenticated app's webhook URL and reports what the receiver answered.

Use it to verify a receiver while you set an app up, instead of waiting for a real event. Requires app signing-JWT authentication, like [Get Authenticated App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-authenticated-app).

The receiver sees the production shape: the same [headers](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#headers) and `v1ed` signature, verifiable against the [signing keys](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#discovery-and-signing-keys), with `webhook-event-type` set to `ping` and a payload naming the app. A ping belongs to no installation, so the `webhook-installation-id` header and the envelope's `installationId` are both absent.

Origin sends the ping once, synchronously, and reports the outcome in the response. There are no retries, and a ping is not a domain event: it never appears in [List Webhook Deliveries](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-webhook-deliveries) and cannot be redelivered. A receiver that fails is reported in the response rather than as an error. An app with no webhook URL configured returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

#### Request Body

The request takes no fields. Send an empty JSON object.

#### Response Fields

`deliveryId` string

The test delivery's `webhook-id`, matching the header the receiver saw.

`eventId` string

Event ID inside the signed envelope, the same value as `event.id`.

`delivered` boolean

True when the receiver answered with a `2xx` status before the delivery timeout. Always present.

`responseStatusCode` integer

HTTP status the receiver answered with, or `0` when no response arrived because the connection failed or timed out. Always present.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/app/webhook/pings' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "deliveryId": "whd_01k2ja2000e0080000000000j9",
  "eventId": "evt_01k2ja2000e0080000000000r5",
  "delivered": true,
  "responseStatusCode": 200
}
```

### Get App

GET

`/v1/origin/apps/{appId}`

Requires scope `namespace:apps:read` (user access token).

Returns a single app by its identifier. This is the management read for app publishers; [Get Authenticated App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-authenticated-app) is the equivalent self-read for the app's own JWT credential.

#### Path Parameters

`appId` string Required

App identifier, prefixed `app_`.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Globally unique app identifier, prefixed `app_`.

`displayName` string

Human-facing app name.

`webhookUrl` string

### Update App

PATCH

`/v1/origin/apps/{appId}`

Requires scope `app:settings:write` (user access token).

Updates an app's settings. Omitted fields are left unchanged, and at least one settable field must be provided. Clearing `webhookUrl` by sending an empty string disables outbound webhook delivery and cancels the app's pending deliveries; setting a URL again does not resurrect cancelled deliveries.

`appId` string Required

App identifier, prefixed `app_`.

#### Request Body

`displayName` string

New human-facing app name. Must not be empty when provided.

`webhookUrl` string

New outbound webhook delivery URL, an absolute HTTPS URL. An empty string disables webhook delivery and cancels the app's pending deliveries.

`events` object

Clean replace of the webhook event subscriptions. Omit to leave them unchanged.

`events.events` array

The app's complete new set of webhook event subscriptions. An empty list clears repository subscriptions; `installation.*` events are always delivered and cannot be listed here.

`description` string

New app description. Omit to leave it unchanged; an empty string clears it.

`websiteUrl` string

New publisher website. Omit to leave it unchanged; an empty string clears it.

`installationRedirectUris` object

Clean replace of the OAuth install callback allowlist. Omit to leave it unchanged.

`installationRedirectUris.installationRedirectUris` array

The complete new allowlist. An empty list clears it.

`defaultScopes` object

Clean replace of the app's default install scopes. Omit to leave them unchanged.

`defaultScopes.scopes` array

### Add App Signing Key

POST

`/v1/origin/apps/{appId}/signing_keys`

Requires scope `app:settings:write` (user access token).

Adds a signing key to an app. Apps hold a bounded set of active signing keys; adding a key beyond the limit returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400) until another key is revoked. A key that is already registered returns `AlreadyExists` (HTTP 409 Conflict).

#### Path Parameters

`appId` string Required

App identifier, prefixed `app_`.

#### Request Body

`publicKey` string Required

PEM SPKI Ed25519 public key to add to the app's signing key set.

#### Response Fields

`kid` string

Key ID: the base64url-encoded SHA-256 digest of the key's SPKI DER encoding. Use it as the JWT `kid` header and to revoke the key.

`createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for when the key was registered.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/apps/APP_ID/signing_keys' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "publicKey": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMCowBQYDK2VwAyEAq9zTf3hL6wXe1cVj0bYs5mKR8uDnG2oAaPp4NiEkKlM=\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"
}'
```

**Response shape:**

  "createdAt": "2026-08-02T14:45:00Z"
}
```

### Revoke App Signing Key

DELETE

`/v1/origin/apps/{appId}/signing_keys/{kid}`

Requires scope `app:settings:write` (user access token).

Revokes an app signing key by its key ID. App JWTs signed with a revoked key stop authenticating. The last active signing key cannot be revoked; that request returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400). The response body is empty.

#### Path Parameters

`appId` string Required

App identifier, prefixed `app_`.

`kid` string Required

Key ID of the signing key to revoke.

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/apps/{appId}/signing_keys/{kid}' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

### List Namespace Apps

GET

`/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/apps`

Requires scope `namespace:apps:read` (user access token).

Lists the apps a namespace owns, newest first. Responses carry display metadata only; read one app's webhook configuration with [Get App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-app).

#### Path Parameters

`namespaceSlug` string Required

Slug of the namespace whose apps to list.

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Max apps to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page.

#### Response Fields

`apps` array

Page of apps the namespace owns.

`apps[].id` string

Globally unique app identifier, prefixed `app_`.

`apps[].displayName` string

Human-facing app name.

`apps[].description` string

Publisher-provided description. Empty when unset.

`nextPageToken` string

Opaque cursor for the next page; empty when there are no more pages.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/apps' \

{
  "apps": [
    {
      "id": "app_01k2ja2000e0080000000000a1",
      "displayName": "CI Status Bot",
      "description": "Posts CI status on pull requests."

      "displayName": "Deploy Bot",
      "description": ""
    }
  ],
  "nextPageToken": ""
}
```

### Create App

POST

`/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/apps`

Requires scope `namespace:apps:create` (user access token).

Creates an app owned by a namespace. Apps are created private. Generate the Ed25519 key pair locally and send only the public key; Origin stores it to verify the app's JWTs. Invalid webhook URLs, event types, redirect URIs, or scopes return `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

The namespace owner must be eligible to write to Origin when the request is made, the same requirement [Create Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-repo) carries. A user owner must be on a Pro, Pro Student, Pro+, Ultra, or Start plan. A team owner must have an active paid team plan, must not be on Privacy Mode (Legacy), and must not have Origin turned off by a team admin. An ineligible owner returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400). Origin reads the namespace owner's eligibility, not the calling user's.

#### Path Parameters

`namespaceSlug` string Required

Slug of the namespace that will own the app.

#### Request Body

`displayName` string Required

Human-facing app name. Must not be empty.

`publicKey` string Required

PEM SPKI Ed25519 public key for the app's signing key pair. See [Generate an app signing key](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#generate-an-app-signing-key).

`webhookUrl` string

Outbound webhook delivery URL, an absolute HTTPS URL. Empty means the app receives no webhook deliveries.

`events` array

Webhook event subscriptions, as event slugs from [Events](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events). Unknown event types are rejected. An empty list subscribes to no events, so the app receives only the `installation.*` events, which are always delivered and cannot be listed here.

`description` string

Short app description.

`websiteUrl` string

Publisher website, an absolute HTTPS URL.

`installationRedirectUris` array

OAuth install callback allowlist: absolute HTTPS URIs without a fragment, matched exactly at authorize time.

`defaultScopes` array

Default scopes offered when the app is installed, as catalog scope strings such as `repository:contents:read`. Installs still accept scopes explicitly.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Globally unique app identifier, prefixed `app_`.

`displayName` string

Human-facing app name.

`webhookUrl` string

Registered HTTPS URL that receives the app's webhook deliveries. Empty when the app receives no deliveries.

`events` array

Webhook event subscriptions configured for the app. The `installation.*` events are always delivered and never appear here.

`createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for app creation.

`updatedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for the latest app metadata update.

`installationRedirectUris` array

OAuth install callback allowlist: redirect URIs an app-initiated install can return to, matched exactly at authorize time.

`namespaceSlug` string

Slug of the namespace that owns the app.

`description` string

Publisher-provided app description. Empty when unset.

`websiteUrl` string

Publisher website. Empty when unset.

`defaultScopes` array

Default scopes offered when the app is installed, as catalog scope strings.

```bash

}
```

### Add App Installation Repositories

POST

`/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/installations/{installationId}/repos`

Requires scope `namespace:installations:write` (user access token).

Adds repositories to an installation's repository selection and returns the updated installation. The write is additive: the listed repositories are unioned with the current selection, a request whose repositories are all already granted succeeds without changing anything, and the installation's scopes never change.

Every listed repository must belong to the target namespace, or the request returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400) and grants nothing. The same error covers an installation that already carries every repository in the namespace (`repoSelectionMode` is `all`), one that is suspended, and one that predates per-installation scopes. An installation that does not exist, or that belongs to another namespace, returns `404`; the message names the consent page to open when the app has never been installed in the namespace, because this endpoint cannot perform a first install.

The caller must be a Cursor user credential with installation-management access to the namespace. App tokens, installation tokens, and service accounts cannot change an installation's repositories.

#### Path Parameters

`namespaceSlug` string Required

Slug of the namespace the installation belongs to.

`installationId` string Required

Installation identifier.

#### Request Body

`repoIds` array Required

Repository IDs to add to the installation's selection. At least one is required; values are deduplicated, and repositories that are already part of the selection are accepted without change. Every listed repository must belong to the namespace, or the request fails and nothing is granted.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Installation identifier that the app stores and uses to mint installation access tokens.

`appId` string

Identifier of the installed app.

`target` object

Owner selected by the customer for this installation.

`target.slug` string

URL-facing owner slug used with the owner ID to identify the repository owner.

`target.id` string

Origin owner identifier.

`target.type` string

Owner namespace type. Output-only. Allowed values: `team`, `user`. Omitted when unknown.

`createdAt` string

RFC 3339 installation creation timestamp.

`updatedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for the latest installation update.

`repoSelectionMode` string

Repository grant mode; exactly all or selected.

`scopes` array

Scopes approved for the installation.

`installedBy` object

The user who originally installed the app, not the most recent re-consent actor. Output-only. Absent when that user record can no longer be read.

`installedBy.id` string

Public identifier for the user, prefixed `user_`.

`installedBy.email` string

Email address of the user.

`installedBy.displayName` string

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`installedBy.handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle, without the `@` prefix. Present only while that profile is publicly visible; omitted otherwise.

`suspendedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp set while the installation is suspended. Omitted while the installation is active.

`deletedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for the installation's deletion. Carried only on the `installation.deleted` webhook snapshot; a deleted installation no longer resolves through the API, so this endpoint never returns it.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/namespaces/NAMESPACE_SLUG/installations/INSTALLATION_ID/repos' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

## Repositories

`cloneUrl` is an output-only HTTPS clone URL. [Get Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-repo) includes `cloneUrl`.

Partners discover their repositories through [List App Installation Repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-app-installation-repositories). Namespace-wide repository listing and creation are not part of the partner API.

### List Namespaces

GET

`/v1/origin/namespaces`

Requires no scope (user access token).

Lists the namespaces you can list repositories in, ordered by slug.

The candidates are the namespaces of your teams, your personal namespace, and the namespaces holding repositories you were granted. Only those on which you hold `namespace:repositories:read` are returned, so every result is a valid `ownerSlug` for [List Repos](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-repos).

The caller must be a Cursor user credential; the call needs no scope of its own. App tokens, installation tokens, and service accounts receive `PermissionDenied` (HTTP 403).

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Max namespaces to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page. `pageSize` on a follow-up request applies to that page; omit it to keep the previous page size.

#### Response Fields

`namespaces` array

Namespaces you can list repositories in, ordered by slug.

`namespaces[].namespace` object

Owner reference for the namespace.

`namespaces[].namespace.slug` string

URL-facing owner slug. Use it as `ownerSlug` with [List Repos](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-repos).

`namespaces[].namespace.id` string

Origin owner identifier.

`namespaces[].namespace.type` string

Owner namespace type. Output-only. Allowed values: `team`, `user`. Omitted when unknown.

`namespaces[].viewerCanCreateRepositories` boolean

Whether [Create Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-repo) in this namespace would pass authorization and the owner's plan and settings checks for you.

`nextPageToken` string

Opaque cursor for the next page; empty when there are no more pages.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/namespaces' \

### Update Repo

PATCH

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}`

Requires scope `repository:settings:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Updates repository settings. Omitted fields are left unchanged, and at least one settable field must be provided.

Settings apply as independent groups in a fixed order: default branch, automatic head-branch deletion, visibility, then merge methods. The update is not atomic across groups. When a group is rejected, the groups before it in that order are already applied and stay applied, so retry with the rejected group corrected to converge on the state you asked for. The response carries the repository as of the last group applied.

A request that sets no field returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). A concurrent change to the default branch returns `409 Conflict`.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`defaultBranch` string

New default branch. Must name an existing branch. Supported only on repositories that neither pull from nor push to an upstream source; other repositories return `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

`allowMergeCommit` boolean

Whether pull requests can land as merge commits. Must be sent together with `allowSquashMerge`, and at least one of the two must be `true`. Sending one without the other returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`allowSquashMerge` boolean

Whether pull requests can land as squash merges. Must be sent together with `allowMergeCommit`, and at least one of the two must be `true`. Sending one without the other returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`deleteBranchOnMerge` boolean

Whether the head branch is deleted automatically on merge. Supported only on repositories whose pull requests live on this API; a repository that pulls from an upstream source returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

`visibility` string

New repository visibility. Allowed values: `internal`, `private`. Omit it to leave the visibility unchanged.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Origin repository identifier.

`name` string

Repository name within its owner.

`fullName` string

Combined owner and repository name, such as acme/api.

`owner` object

Owner reference for the repository.

### Create Repo

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}`

Requires scope `namespace:repositories:create` (user access token).

Creates a repo belonging to an owner.

The owner must be eligible to write to Origin when the request is made. A user owner must be on a Pro, Pro Student, Pro+, Ultra, or Start plan. A team owner must have an active paid team plan, must not be on Privacy Mode (Legacy), and must not have Origin turned off by a team admin. An ineligible owner returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400). Reading existing repositories does not carry this requirement.

Repository names are claimed case-insensitively. A name that differs only in case from a repository the owner already has is rejected, so `widgets` and `Widgets` cannot coexist in one namespace. The name you send is stored as you send it.

The first push to a new repo can retarget its default branch. When that push only creates branches and none of them is the repo's stored default branch, Origin sets the default branch to the created branch, or to `main` or `master` when the push creates several and one of those names is among them. The default branch is otherwise unchanged. Read the current value from [Get Repo](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-repo).

### List Branches

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/branches`

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists the repo's branches and tip commits in ascending name order, paginated with `page_size` and `page_token`.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Max branches to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page. Encodes the resume position. `pageSize` on a follow-up request applies to that page; omit it to keep the previous page size.

#### Response Fields

`branches` array

Paginated branch records containing branch name and tip commit SHA.

`branches[].name` string

Branch name.

`branches[].commit` object

The commit at the tip of the branch.

`branches[].commit.sha` string

Full hex SHA of the commit at the tip of the branch.

`nextPageToken` string

Opaque cursor for the next page; empty when there are no more pages.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/branches' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "branches": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "commit": {
        "sha": "9a41f0c3d2b8e7f6a5c4d3e2f1b0a9c8d7e6f5a4"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Get Repository Collaborator Permission

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/collaborators/{userId}/permission`

Requires scope `repository:members:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns a user's permission on a repository, combined from their direct and inherited grants. The result describes the user's grants and does not depend on the credential you call with. Only repositories whose source of truth is Origin are supported. A user whose grants give no access, an ID that names no active account, a mirrored repository, and a repository that does not exist or is not visible to you all return the same `404`.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`userId` string Required

Public ID of the user (`user_…`). A malformed ID returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Response Fields

`user` object

The collaborator. Always set.

`user.id` string

Public identifier for the user.

`user.email` string

Email address of the user. Always set.

`user.displayName` string

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`user.handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle, without the `@` prefix. Present only while that profile is publicly visible; omitted otherwise.

`permission` string

The user's permission on the repository, combined from every grant that reaches it: grants on the repository and on its owner, whether held directly, through a group, or through the owning team's built-in groups. Owner-level `PERMISSION_READ`, `PERMISSION_CONTRIBUTOR`, and `PERMISSION_WRITE` grants count only on internal repositories, and `PERMISSION_CONTRIBUTOR` counts as `read`. The highest level wins, so the value can differ from the `permission` of any single grant that [List Repository Grants](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-repository-grants) returns. It is `custom` when a custom policy gives repository access that none of the user's preset grants does. Allowed values: `read`, `write`, `admin`, `custom`.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/collaborators/USER_ID/permission' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "user_01k2ja2000e0080000000000c3",
    "email": "jane@acme.dev",
    "displayName": "Jane Doe"
  },
  "permission": "write"
}
```

### Get Repo Tarball

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/tarball/{ref}`

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Downloads a gzip-compressed tar of the repository tree at `ref`.

Origin keys the archive on the repository and the commit `ref` resolves to. The first request for a given commit responds `200` with `Content-Type: application/gzip` and streams the archive as the response body. Later requests for the same commit respond `302` with an empty body and a signed download URL in `Location`, valid for 15 minutes; follow the redirect to fetch the bytes. The archive contains a single top-level directory named `{ownerSlug}-{repoName}-{shortSha}/`, where `shortSha` is the first 7 hex characters of the resolved commit, matching the layout of GitHub's tarball endpoint. An empty repository returns `ABORTED` (HTTP 409 Conflict), and a ref that does not resolve returns `404`.

Send the ref as a query parameter instead of a path segment to address a ref containing "/": `GET /v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/tarball?ref=refs/heads/main`. Omit it to archive the repository's default branch.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`ref` string Required

Commit SHA (full or abbreviated hex), bare branch or tag name, fully qualified `refs/heads/...` or `refs/tags/...`, or symbolic `HEAD`. Not a glob or revspec, so `<rev>~3` is rejected. Empty uses the repository default branch.

#### Response Fields

`sha` string

Resolved commit object ID: 40- or 64-character hex. Returned to Connect and JSON callers; over REST, read it from the archive filename or the signed URL.

`downloadUrl` string

Short-lived signed download URL, valid for 15 minutes. Empty when the response streams the archive inline, which is the first request for this repository and commit. Over REST the same URL is sent as the `Location` header on the `302`.

```bash
curl --request GET --location --output repo.tar.gz \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/tarball/HEAD' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "downloadUrl": "https://artifacts.origin.cursor.com/tarballs/0192f7a4-6c1e-7b3a-9f21-3d54c9a7e6b0/9a41f0c3d2b8e7f6a5c4d3e2f1b0a9c8d7e6f5a4.tar.gz?Expires=1767225600&Signature=EXAMPLE&Key-Pair-Id=KEXAMPLE123",
  "sha": "9a41f0c3d2b8e7f6a5c4d3e2f1b0a9c8d7e6f5a4"
}
```

### Sync Mirror

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}:syncMirror`

Requires scope `repository:mirror:sync` (installation access token or user access token).

Synchronizes one ref of a mirrored repository from its upstream source. Returns HTTP `200` when the sync target is satisfied, or HTTP `202` when the sync is still pending. `wait=false` (the default) schedules the sync and usually returns `202`; it returns `200` immediately when `sha` is already reachable from `ref`. `wait=true` blocks until satisfied or the wait budget (\~2 minutes) expires; expiry still returns `202` and the sync continues in the background. Repositories that do not pull from an upstream source are rejected.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`ref` string Required

Full git ref name to fetch. Must start with `refs/` and name a ref after that prefix, for example `refs/heads/main` or `refs/tags/v1`. Short names such as `main` are rejected with `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

`wait` boolean

When true, block until synced or the wait budget expires. Defaults to false.

`sha` string

Optional full commit object ID: 40- or 64-character hex. Omit or leave empty to wait on the tip of `ref`. When set and reachable from `ref`, the call returns early without waiting for other mirror work to drain. Other values are rejected with `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.

#### Response Fields

`synced` boolean

True when the sync target is known to be satisfied, false while the sync is still pending. Always present, mirroring the HTTP status: `200` when true, `202` when false.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME:syncMirror' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "ref": "refs/heads/main",
  "wait": true
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "synced": true
}
```

## Checks

- The first run upsert creates its suite automatically.
- Required checks match the installing app plus the suite `key`, and optionally a run `key`. `name` is display-only and is not used for matching.
- Keep `key` values stable across attempts and readable for users, since required-check configuration is keyed on them.
- Reuse `externalId` to update an attempt, which discards that attempt's previous result; use a new `externalId` for a retry so the earlier attempt stays as history.
- Use `checkRun.output` for human-readable results:
  - `title`: short result headline, up to 255 characters.
  - `summary`: primary Markdown summary, up to 65,535 UTF-8 bytes.
  - `text`: extended Markdown details, up to 65,535 UTF-8 bytes.
- Use `detailsUrl` for a link to the provider's external results page.

[Check runs](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#check-runs) defines which attempt is current, how `externalUpdatedAt` orders writes and what `outcome` reports, and the timestamp and deadline rules these endpoints share.

### Post Check Run

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/check-runs`

Requires scope `repository:checks:write` (installation access token).

Upserts a check suite + check run using an installation access token with `repository:checks:write`. The write is attributed to the app that owns the authenticated installation. A repeated call with the same `(repo, head_sha, suite.key, check.key)` updates the existing check run in place rather than creating a duplicate.

The endpoint atomically resolves or creates the suite attempt and upserts one run attempt. `externalUpdatedAt` orders updates to the same run identity; stale retries cannot overwrite newer state, and a `cancelled` completion cannot replace a stored passing result; see [Ordering writes](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#ordering-writes). A post that is ignored as stale, and a post that repeats the stored values, both still return `200` with the stored suite and run, so read `outcome` to tell `ignored_stale` and `unchanged` apart from `created` and `updated`. `updatedAt` does not move for either, so it cannot distinguish them.

Within a suite, the current attempt for a run `key` is the run with the newest `externalUpdatedAt`, breaking ties by `createdAt` and then by `id`, newest first. Each `(actor, key, externalId)` reported against a commit is one suite attempt, and the current attempt per `(actor, key)` is the one whose runs carry the newest `externalUpdatedAt`, with a suite that has no runs ranking by its own `createdAt`. A run is current for its commit only while its suite is the commit's current attempt, so a run posted under an older suite `externalId` stays hidden from the commit-scoped listings while another attempt of that suite has newer activity. At both levels, a cancelled attempt does not displace a passing one; [Attempts and the current attempt](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#attempts-and-the-current-attempt) has the rule. Superseded attempts stay readable by id.

`deadlineAt` records an optional deadline on the run. Origin stores it and returns it on reads until the run reaches `completed`. A deadline more than 24 hours in the future is rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) rather than clamped.

When the deadline passes on a run still `in_progress` or `failing`, Origin completes the run itself with a `timed_out` conclusion, setting `completedAt` if the run had none, and delivers `repository.check_run.completed`. Expiry runs as a periodic sweep rather than on a per-run timer, so expiry lands some minutes after the deadline rather than at it. The sweep runs about every 30 minutes by default, an operational setting that can change. A `queued` run never expires, and neither does a run that carries no `deadlineAt`. Completing the run yourself before the deadline clears it. Origin leaves the run's `externalUpdatedAt` untouched when it times a run out, so a later completion from your provider can still overwrite the `timed_out` conclusion. A timed-out run keeps its expired deadline until a re-request or a `completed` post clears it, and a later post that reopens it as `in_progress` or `failing` without a new `deadlineAt` before then gets the expired deadline back, so the next sweep times the run out again.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`headSha` string Required

Head commit SHA the check run is reported against (40- or 64-char hex).

`baseSha` string

Comparison base the check run was evaluated against (40- or 64-character hex): a pull request version's `baseSha`. It is part of the check suite and check run identity, so posting the same `externalId` and `key` against another base creates a separate attempt instead of overwriting the first. Omit it for a base-agnostic run; a later post must repeat the same value to address the same attempt. An empty string returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`checkSuite` object Required

The suite the check run belongs to; upserted alongside the check run.

`checkSuite.key` string Required

Stable, app-chosen key identifying the logical suite across attempts.

`checkSuite.name` string Required

Human-facing suite name.

`checkSuite.detailsUrl` string

Optional link to more detail about the suite as a whole.

`checkSuite.externalId` string Required

Provider-assigned immutable identity for this suite attempt.

`checkRun` object Required

The check run to upsert.

`checkRun.key` string Required

Stable, app-chosen key identifying the logical check across attempts.

`checkRun.name` string Required

Human-facing check-run name.

`checkRun.status` string Required

Settable values: `CHECK_RUN_LIFECYCLE_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED`, `queued`, `in_progress`, `failing`, `completed`. `failing` marks a run that keeps going after a step failed: post it without a `conclusion`, then post `completed` with the verdict when the run ends. The schema also lists `rerequested`, which only Origin sets on re-request; a request carrying it returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`checkRun.conclusion` string

Required iff `status == completed`. Allowed values: `CHECK_RUN_CONCLUSION_UNSPECIFIED`, `success`, `failure`, `neutral`, `cancelled`, `skipped`, `timed_out`, `action_required`, `stale`.

`checkRun.externalUpdatedAt` string Required

The external system's last-update time. Used to order concurrent updates so a stale retry can't overwrite newer state.

`checkRun.startedAt` string

When the check run started. A value more than 60 seconds in the future returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`checkRun.completedAt` string

When the check run completed. A value more than 60 seconds in the future returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400), as does a value that precedes `startedAt` when both are posted together.

`checkRun.detailsUrl` string

Optional link to more detail about this specific check run (e.g. the provider's job/build URL).

`checkRun.externalId` string Required

Provider-assigned immutable identity for this check attempt.

`checkRun.output` object

Human-readable output for this check run.

`checkRun.output.title` string

Short headline for the output. Maximum length: 255 characters.

`checkRun.output.summary` string

Summary of the output. May contain Markdown. Maximum UTF-8 size: 65535 bytes.

`checkRun.output.text` string

Detailed output. May contain Markdown. Maximum UTF-8 size: 65535 bytes.

`checkRun.deadlineAt` string

Deadline for the check run, as an RFC 3339 timestamp. Values more than 24 hours in the future are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) rather than clamped. Omit it on a create to record no deadline; omit it on an update to leave the stored deadline unchanged.

`checkRun.isRerequestable` boolean

Declares that the run can be run again on request. Setting it to `true` commits your app to subscribing to [`repository.check_run.rerequested`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events) and answering each delivery by posting a fresh run for the same head SHA and `key`: either a new run under a new `externalId`, which keeps the old attempt as history, or an update of the re-requested run under the same `externalId`, which refreshes it in place. Until that fresh post arrives the re-requested run reads as pending in the commit's latest check state, so a required check blocks merging and the pull request shows the run as awaiting its re-run; declaring re-requestability without answering strands the check. Origin does not verify the subscription when you post. Omit it to keep the stored value, which is `false` on a new run; send `false` to withdraw the declaration.

#### Response Fields

`checkSuite` object

The upserted check suite.

`checkSuite.id` string

Server-assigned check suite identifier.

`checkSuite.repository` object

Repository reference for the suite.

`checkRun.isRerequestable` boolean

Whether the reporting app declared this run re-requestable.

`checkRun.rerequestedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp of the outstanding re-request. Absent when no re-request is pending, and cleared when the app that owns the run posts again. While it is set, `status` is `rerequested` and the run stays in the commit's latest check state and reads as pending, with `conclusion` and the timings still carrying the superseded result, so a required check blocks merging until the app answers.

`checkRun.rerequestedBy` object

Principal that asked for the re-run, carrying the same actor variants as `actor`. Present whenever `rerequestedAt` is set, and cleared together with it.

`outcome` string

### Batch Upsert Check Runs

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/check-runs:batchUpsert`

Requires scope `repository:checks:write` (installation access token).

Atomically upserts several check runs belonging to one suite. The request accepts at most 10 runs and rejects duplicate `(external_id, key)` identities. Every run is committed or the entire request is rolled back.

Each run accepts the same optional `deadlineAt` as [Post Check Run](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#post-check-run).

Origin applies the `externalUpdatedAt` ordering rule to each run separately. A run ignored as stale does not fail the batch: the response carries the stored run in its place, and `results[].outcome` reports each run's verdict in request order.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`headSha` string Required

Head commit SHA the check runs are reported against (40- or 64-char hex).

`baseSha` string

Comparison base every check run in this request was evaluated against (40- or 64-character hex); see `baseSha` on [Post Check Run](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#post-check-run). Omit it for base-agnostic runs. An empty string returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`checkSuite` object Required

The suite shared by every check run in this request.

`checkSuite.key` string Required

Stable, app-chosen key identifying the logical suite across attempts.

`checkSuite.name` string Required

Human-facing suite name.

`checkSuite.detailsUrl` string

Optional link to more detail about the suite as a whole.

`checkSuite.externalId` string Required

Provider-assigned immutable identity for this suite attempt.

`checkRuns` array Required

Check runs to upsert, in response order. Must contain 1-10 entries with unique `(external_id, key)` identities.

`checkRuns[0].key` string Required

Stable, app-chosen key identifying the logical check across attempts.

`checkRuns[0].name` string Required

Human-facing check-run name.

`checkRuns[0].status` string Required

Settable values: `CHECK_RUN_LIFECYCLE_STATUS_UNSPECIFIED`, `queued`, `in_progress`, `failing`, `completed`. `failing` marks a run that keeps going after a step failed: post it without a `conclusion`, then post `completed` with the verdict when the run ends. The schema also lists `rerequested`, which only Origin sets on re-request; a request carrying it returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`checkRuns[0].conclusion` string

Required iff `status == completed`. Allowed values: `CHECK_RUN_CONCLUSION_UNSPECIFIED`, `success`, `failure`, `neutral`, `cancelled`, `skipped`, `timed_out`, `action_required`, `stale`.

`checkRuns[0].externalUpdatedAt` string Required

The external system's last-update time. Used to order concurrent updates so a stale retry can't overwrite newer state.

`checkRuns[0].startedAt` string

When the check run started. A value more than 60 seconds in the future returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`checkRuns[0].completedAt` string

When the check run completed. A value more than 60 seconds in the future returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400), as does a value that precedes `startedAt` when both are posted together.

`checkRuns[0].detailsUrl` string

Optional link to more detail about this specific check run (e.g. the provider's job/build URL).

`checkRuns[0].externalId` string Required

Provider-assigned immutable identity for this check attempt.

`checkRuns[0].output` object

Human-readable output for this check run.

`checkRuns[0].output.title` string

Short headline for the output. Maximum length: 255 characters.

`checkRuns[0].output.summary` string

Summary of the output. May contain Markdown. Maximum UTF-8 size: 65535 bytes.

`checkRuns[0].output.text` string

Detailed output. May contain Markdown. Maximum UTF-8 size: 65535 bytes.

`checkRuns[0].deadlineAt` string

Deadline for the check run, as an RFC 3339 timestamp. Values more than 24 hours in the future are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) rather than clamped. Omit it on a create to record no deadline; omit it on an update to leave the stored deadline unchanged.

`checkRuns[0].isRerequestable` boolean

Declares that the run can be run again on request. Setting it to `true` commits your app to subscribing to [`repository.check_run.rerequested`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events) and answering each delivery by posting a fresh run for the same head SHA and `key`: either a new run under a new `externalId`, which keeps the old attempt as history, or an update of the re-requested run under the same `externalId`, which refreshes it in place. Until that fresh post arrives the re-requested run reads as pending in the commit's latest check state, so a required check blocks merging and the pull request shows the run as awaiting its re-run; declaring re-requestability without answering strands the check. Origin does not verify the subscription when you post. Omit it to keep the stored value, which is `false` on a new run; send `false` to withdraw the declaration.

Principal that asked for the re-run, carrying the same actor variants as `actor`. Present whenever `rerequestedAt` is set, and cleared together with it.

`results` array

One result per posted run, in request order.

`results[].checkRun` object

The stored check run after this call: the posted values when `outcome` is `created` or `updated`, and the run as it already was otherwise. Carries the same fields as `checkRuns[]`.

`results[].outcome` string

What this call did to `results[].checkRun`. Allowed values: `created`, `updated`, `unchanged`, `ignored_stale`. A run ignored as stale and a run that repeated the stored values both return the stored run, so this field is the only way to tell them apart.

### Get Check Run

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/check-runs/{checkRunId}`

Requires scope `repository:checks:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns a single check run by server-assigned id (`cr_...`).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`checkRunId` string Required

Server-assigned check-run id (`cr_...`).

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Server-assigned check run identifier.

`repository` object

Repository reference for the run.

`repository.id` string

Repository identifier in a container reference.

`repository.name` string

Repository name in a container reference.

`repository.owner` object

Owner reference for the repository.

`repository.owner.slug` string

URL-facing owner slug used with the owner ID to identify the repository owner.

`repository.owner.id` string

Origin owner identifier.

`repository.owner.type` string

Owner namespace type. Output-only. Allowed values: `team`, `user`. Omitted when unknown.

`checkSuite` object

Reference to the containing check suite.

`checkSuite.id` string

Server-assigned identifier of the containing check suite.

`sha` string

Commit SHA to which the run is attached.

`baseSha` string

Comparison base this run was reported against (lowercase hex), when the reporting app supplied one; always the owning suite's `baseSha`. Absent for a base-agnostic run.

`key` string

Stable app-chosen logical run identity; required checks may match on app, suite key, and this key.

`name` string

Display-only run name; it is not used for required-check matching.

`status` string

Lifecycle status; queued, in\_progress, failing, completed, or rerequested. A failing run is still going but its app already knows it will not pass: it has no conclusion yet and counts as pending for required checks. A rerequested run is a completed run whose re-run was asked for and the owning app has not answered yet: treat it as pending and render it like queued.

`conclusion` string

Present for a completed or rerequested run; success, failure, neutral, cancelled, skipped, timed\_out, action\_required, or stale. On a rerequested run it is the superseded attempt's verdict, so read it only when `status` is `completed`.

`detailsUrl` string

Separate link to the provider's full result page.

`externalUpdatedAt` string

External update timestamp used to order updates so stale retries cannot replace newer state.

`startedAt` string

Provider-reported RFC 3339 start time when supplied.

`completedAt` string

Provider-reported RFC 3339 completion time when supplied.

`createdAt` string

RFC 3339 run creation timestamp.

`updatedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for the latest persisted run update.

`externalId` string

Provider identity for one attempt. Reuse it to update that attempt and use a new value for a retry.

`actor` object

Public actor that produced the run. Always the owning check suite's `actor`.

`actor.user` object

User variant of the actor. Set when a user performed the action.

`actor.user.id` string

Public identifier for the user.

`actor.user.email` string

Email address of the user. Always set when the user variant is present.

`actor.user.displayName` string

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`actor.user.handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle, without the `@` prefix. Present only while that profile is publicly visible; omitted otherwise.

`actor.app` object

App variant of the actor. Set when an app performed the action.

`actor.app.id` string

Public identifier for the app.

`actor.app.displayName` string

The app's registered display name. Omitted when the app cannot be resolved and on Cursor's first-party managed actor.

`actor.serviceAccount` object

Service account variant of the actor. Set when a service account performed the action.

`actor.serviceAccount.id` string

Public identifier for the service account.

`actor.serviceAccount.type` string

Product or feature the service account acts for. Allowed values: `bugbot`, `automations`, `agent_serve`, `agent`, `grok_bot`, `env_builds`. Absent when the account no longer exists or Cursor doesn't describe it. New values can be added; treat an absent or unrecognized value as an account of a product you don't recognize, never as an error.

`actor.serviceAccount.displayName` string

Product name Cursor shows for the service account: `Cursor` for Cursor's own managed accounts, or a Grok bot's name. Never empty when present; a Grok bot whose name can't be read is named `Grok Bot`. Omitted when the account has no product name.

`output` object

Human-readable result object containing title, summary, and longer text when supplied.

`output.title` string

Short headline for the output. Maximum length: 255 characters.

`output.summary` string

Summary of the output. May contain Markdown. Maximum UTF-8 size: 65535 bytes.

`output.text` string

Detailed output. May contain Markdown. Maximum UTF-8 size: 65535 bytes.

`deadlineAt` string

Deadline recorded for the check run, as an RFC 3339 timestamp. Absent when the run has no deadline, including after the run completes.

`isRerequestable` boolean

Whether the reporting app declared this run re-requestable.

`rerequestedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp of the outstanding re-request. Absent when no re-request is pending, and cleared when the app that owns the run posts again. While it is set, `status` is `rerequested` and the run stays in the commit's latest check state and reads as pending, with `conclusion` and the timings still carrying the superseded result, so a required check blocks merging until the app answers.

`rerequestedBy` object

Principal that asked for the re-run, carrying the same actor variants as `actor`. Present whenever `rerequestedAt` is set, and cleared together with it.

### List Check Run Annotations

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/check-runs/{checkRunId}/annotations`

Requires scope `repository:checks:read` (installation access token or user access token).

### Create Check Run Annotations

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/check-runs/{checkRunId}/annotations`

Requires scope `repository:checks:write` (installation access token).

Appends between 1 and 25 annotations to a check run in a single atomic batch.

A check run holds at most 100 annotations. A batch that would take it past that limit is rejected with `ResourceExhausted` (HTTP 429) and nothing is written; a batch outside the 1 to 25 range is rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). The operation is append-only and is not idempotent, so retrying after an ambiguous transport failure can append duplicates and consume capacity. Identical content is allowed.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`checkRunId` string Required

Server-assigned check run ID.

Annotation title. Maximum length: 255 Unicode characters.

`annotations[].rawDetails` string

Raw detail text. Maximum 65,535 bytes of UTF-8.

`annotations[].location` object

Source location the annotation points at. Omit for a run-level annotation that is not tied to a line of code.

`annotations[].location.path` string Required

Canonical repository-relative file path. Maximum 4,096 bytes of UTF-8.

`annotations[].location.startLine` integer Required

First line of the range. 1-based and inclusive.

`annotations[].location.endLine` integer Required

Last line of the range. 1-based and inclusive, and at or after `startLine`.

`annotations[].location.columns` object

Column range within the line. Supported only when `startLine` and `endLine` are the same line, and both columns must be sent together.

`annotations[].location.columns.startColumn` integer

First column of the range. 1-based and inclusive.

`annotations[].location.columns.endColumn` integer

Last column of the range. 1-based and inclusive, and at or after `startColumn`.

### Rerequest Check Run

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/check-runs/{checkRunId}/rerequest`

Requires scope `repository:contents:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Asks the app that reported a check run to run it again. Origin records the request on the run as `rerequestedAt` and notifies the owning app with [`repository.check_run.rerequested`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events). The app answers by posting a fresh run for the same head SHA and `key`, either a new run or an update of this one, which clears `rerequestedAt` and stores the posted status. While the request is outstanding the run's `status` is `rerequested`; its `conclusion` and timings keep describing the superseded attempt. The call returns the run with `rerequestedAt` set and `status` `rerequested`.

The run must be `completed`, must carry `isRerequestable`, must be the current attempt for its `key`, and must sit on the current head of an open pull request. Anything else returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

One re-request can be outstanding per run. A repeat request while `rerequestedAt` is set returns `AlreadyExists` (HTTP 409 Conflict), and the run becomes re-requestable again once the owning app has answered. Any principal holding [`repository:contents:write`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#scopes) can re-request any re-requestable run, whichever app reported it. A `checkRunId` that is unknown, or that belongs to another repository, returns `404`.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`checkRunId` string Required

Server-assigned check-run id (`cr_...`).

#### Request Body

The request takes no fields. Send an empty JSON object.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Server-assigned check run identifier.

`repository` object

Repository reference for the run.

`repository.id` string

Repository identifier in a container reference.

`repository.name` string

Repository name in a container reference.

`repository.owner` object

Owner reference for the repository.

`repository.owner.slug` string

URL-facing owner slug used with the owner ID to identify the repository owner.

`repository.owner.id` string

Origin owner identifier.

`repository.owner.type` string

Owner namespace type. Output-only. Allowed values: `team`, `user`. Omitted when unknown.

`checkSuite` object

Reference to the containing check suite.

`checkSuite.id` string

Server-assigned identifier of the containing check suite.

`sha` string

Commit SHA to which the run is attached.

`baseSha` string

Comparison base this run was reported against (lowercase hex), when the reporting app supplied one; always the owning suite's `baseSha`. Absent for a base-agnostic run.

`key` string

Stable app-chosen logical run identity; required checks may match on app, suite key, and this key.

`name` string

Display-only run name; it is not used for required-check matching.

`status` string

Lifecycle status; queued, in\_progress, failing, completed, or rerequested. A failing run is still going but its app already knows it will not pass: it has no conclusion yet and counts as pending for required checks. A rerequested run is a completed run whose re-run was asked for and the owning app has not answered yet: treat it as pending and render it like queued.

`conclusion` string

Present for a completed or rerequested run; success, failure, neutral, cancelled, skipped, timed\_out, action\_required, or stale. On a rerequested run it is the superseded attempt's verdict, so read it only when `status` is `completed`.

Separate link to the provider's full result page.

`externalUpdatedAt` string

External update timestamp used to order updates so stale retries cannot replace newer state.

`startedAt` string

Provider-reported RFC 3339 start time when supplied.

`createdAt` string

RFC 3339 run creation timestamp.

`updatedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for the latest persisted run update.

`externalId` string

Provider identity for one attempt. Reuse it to update that attempt and use a new value for a retry.

Public actor that produced the run. Always the owning check suite's `actor`.

`actor.user` object

User variant of the actor. Set when a user performed the action.

`actor.user.id` string

Public identifier for the user.

`actor.user.email` string

Email address of the user. Always set when the user variant is present.

`actor.user.displayName` string

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`actor.user.handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle, without the `@` prefix. Present only while that profile is publicly visible; omitted otherwise.

`actor.app` object

App variant of the actor. Set when an app performed the action.

`actor.app.id` string

Public identifier for the app.

`actor.app.displayName` string

The app's registered display name. Omitted when the app cannot be resolved and on Cursor's first-party managed actor.

`actor.serviceAccount` object

Service account variant of the actor. Set when a service account performed the action.

`actor.serviceAccount.id` string

Public identifier for the service account.

`actor.serviceAccount.type` string

Product or feature the service account acts for. Allowed values: `bugbot`, `automations`, `agent_serve`, `agent`, `grok_bot`, `env_builds`.

`actor.serviceAccount.displayName` string

Product name Cursor shows for the service account: `Cursor` for Cursor's own managed accounts, or a Grok bot's name. Never empty when present; a Grok bot whose name can't be read is named `Grok Bot`. Omitted when the account has no product name.

`output` object

Human-readable result object containing title, summary, and longer text when supplied.

`output.title` string

Short headline for the output. Maximum length: 255 characters.

`output.summary` string

`output.text` string

Detailed output. May contain Markdown. Maximum UTF-8 size: 65535 bytes.

`deadlineAt` string

Deadline recorded for the check run, as an RFC 3339 timestamp. Absent when the run has no deadline, including after the run completes.

`isRerequestable` boolean

Whether the reporting app declared this run re-requestable.

`rerequestedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp of the outstanding re-request. Absent when no re-request is pending, and cleared when the app that owns the run posts again. While it is set, `status` is `rerequested` and the run stays in the commit's latest check state and reads as pending, with `conclusion` and the timings still carrying the superseded result, so a required check blocks merging until the app answers.

`rerequestedBy` object

Principal that asked for the re-run, carrying the same actor variants as `actor`. Present whenever `rerequestedAt` is set, and cleared together with it.

```bash
curl --request POST \

### List Check Runs For Suite

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/check-suites/{checkSuiteId}/check-runs`

Requires scope `repository:checks:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists a suite's current check runs. When a run key was reported more than once in the suite, only the latest attempt for that key is returned; superseded attempts are omitted.

A run that has been re-requested stays in the listing and reads as pending, with `status` `rerequested` and `rerequestedAt` set, and its superseded `conclusion` and timings unchanged, until the app that owns it answers. Read a superseded attempt by its own id with [Get Check Run](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-check-run). Paginated.

### List Check Runs For Commit

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/commits/{sha}/check-runs`

Requires scope `repository:checks:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists a commit's current check runs across all suites: only runs belonging to each suite's latest attempt, and within each suite only the latest attempt per run key. Superseded attempts are omitted; [Post Check Run](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#post-check-run) defines which attempt is the latest. A run that has been re-requested stays in the listing and reads as pending, with `status` `rerequested` and `rerequestedAt` set, and its superseded `conclusion` and timings unchanged, until the app that owns it answers. Read a superseded attempt by its own id with [Get Check Run](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-check-run). Optionally filtered by check name and status. Paginated.

Filters apply to the collapsed set, so a run matches on its latest attempt's status and a filter never resurfaces a superseded attempt. Page tokens embed the filters they were minted under, so a token replayed under different filters is rejected; restart pagination when a filter changes.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`sha` string Required

Commit SHA (40- or 64-char hex) to list check runs for.

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Max check runs to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page. Encodes the last-seen check-run id scoped to this commit and to the filters below; reusing a token under different filters returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). `pageSize` on a follow-up request applies to that page; omit it to keep the previous page size.

`checkName` string

Optional exact check-run name filter, matched against `checkRuns[].name`. Omit to list runs under any name.

`status` string

Optional status filter. Allowed values: `queued`, `in_progress`, `failing`, `completed`, `rerequested`. Any other value returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Omit to list runs in any status.

#### Response Fields

Server-assigned identifier of the containing check suite.

`checkRuns[].sha` string

Commit SHA to which the run is attached.

`checkRuns[].baseSha` string

Comparison base this run was reported against (lowercase hex), when the reporting app supplied one; always the owning suite's `baseSha`. Absent for a base-agnostic run.

`checkRuns[].key` string

Stable app-chosen logical run identity; required checks may match on app, suite key, and this key.

`checkRuns[].name` string

Display-only run name; it is not used for required-check matching.

`checkRuns[].status` string

Lifecycle status; queued, in\_progress, failing, completed, or rerequested. A failing run is still going but its app already knows it will not pass: it has no conclusion yet and counts as pending for required checks. A rerequested run is a completed run whose re-run was asked for and the owning app has not answered yet: treat it as pending and render it like queued.

`checkRuns[].conclusion` string

Present for a completed or rerequested run; success, failure, neutral, cancelled, skipped, timed\_out, action\_required, or stale. On a rerequested run it is the superseded attempt's verdict, so read it only when `status` is `completed`.

`checkRuns[].detailsUrl` string

Separate link to the provider's full result page.

`checkRuns[].externalUpdatedAt` string

External update timestamp used to order updates so stale retries cannot replace newer state.

`checkRuns[].startedAt` string

`checkRuns[].completedAt` string

Provider-reported RFC 3339 completion time when supplied.

`checkRuns[].createdAt` string

RFC 3339 run creation timestamp.

`checkRuns[].updatedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for the latest persisted run update.

`checkRuns[].externalId` string

Provider identity for one attempt. Reuse it to update that attempt and use a new value for a retry.

`checkRuns[].actor` object

Public actor that produced the run. Always the owning check suite's `actor`.

`checkRuns[].actor.user` object

User variant of the actor. Set when a user performed the action.

`checkRuns[].actor.user.id` string

Public identifier for the user.

`checkRuns[].actor.user.email` string

Email address of the user. Always set when the user variant is present.

`checkRuns[].actor.user.displayName` string

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`checkRuns[].actor.user.handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle, without the `@` prefix. Present only while that profile is publicly visible; omitted otherwise.

`checkRuns[].actor.app` object

App variant of the actor. Set when an app performed the action.

`checkRuns[].actor.app.id` string

Public identifier for the app.

`checkRuns[].actor.app.displayName` string

The app's registered display name. Omitted when the app cannot be resolved and on Cursor's first-party managed actor.

`checkRuns[].actor.serviceAccount` object

Service account variant of the actor. Set when a service account performed the action.

`checkRuns[].actor.serviceAccount.id` string

Public identifier for the service account.

`checkRuns[].actor.serviceAccount.type` string

Product or feature the service account acts for. Allowed values: `bugbot`, `automations`, `agent_serve`, `agent`, `grok_bot`, `env_builds`. Absent when the account no longer exists or Cursor doesn't describe it. New values can be added; treat an absent or unrecognized value as an account of a product you don't recognize, never as an error.

`checkRuns[].actor.serviceAccount.displayName` string

Product name Cursor shows for the service account: `Cursor` for Cursor's own managed accounts, or a Grok bot's name. Never empty when present; a Grok bot whose name can't be read is named `Grok Bot`. Omitted when the account has no product name.

`checkRuns[].output` object

Human-readable result object containing title, summary, and longer text when supplied.

`checkRuns[].output.title` string

Short headline for the output. Maximum length: 255 characters.

`checkRuns[].output.summary` string

Deadline recorded for the check run, as an RFC 3339 timestamp. Absent when the run has no deadline, including after the run completes.

`checkRuns[].isRerequestable` boolean

Whether the reporting app declared this run re-requestable.

`checkRuns[].rerequestedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp of the outstanding re-request. Absent when no re-request is pending, and cleared when the app that owns the run posts again. While it is set, `status` is `rerequested` and the run stays in the commit's latest check state and reads as pending, with `conclusion` and the timings still carrying the superseded result, so a required check blocks merging until the app answers.

`checkRuns[].rerequestedBy` object

Principal that asked for the re-run, carrying the same actor variants as `actor`. Present whenever `rerequestedAt` is set, and cleared together with it.

`nextPageToken` string

Opaque cursor for the next page; empty when there are no more pages.

### List Check Suites For Commit

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/commits/{sha}/check-suites`

Requires scope `repository:checks:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists check suites reported against a commit. Returns only the latest attempt of each suite, per reporting actor and suite key; superseded attempts are omitted, and [Post Check Run](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#post-check-run) defines which attempt is the latest. Read a superseded attempt by its own id with [Get Check Suite](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-check-suite). Returns suite metadata only (no embedded runs). Paginated.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`sha` string Required

Commit SHA (40- or 64-char hex) to list suites for.

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Max suites to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page. Encodes the last-seen check-suite id scoped to this commit. `pageSize` on a follow-up request applies to that page; omit it to keep the previous page size.

#### Response Fields

`checkSuites` array

Paginated check suites attached to the resolved commit SHA.

`checkSuites[].id` string

Server-assigned check suite identifier.

`checkSuites[].repository` object

Repository reference for the suite.

Owner namespace type. Output-only. Allowed values: `team`, `user`. Omitted when unknown.

`checkSuites[].sha` string

Commit SHA to which the suite is attached.

`checkSuites[].baseSha` string

Comparison base this attempt was reported against (lowercase hex), when the reporting app supplied one: a pull request version's `baseSha`. It is part of the attempt's identity, so an app can report one attempt per head and base pair. Absent for a base-agnostic attempt, which applies to every pull request at `sha`.

`checkSuites[].key` string

Stable app-chosen required-check identity. Required checks match on app plus this key, not name.

`checkSuites[].name` string

Display-only suite name; it is not used for required-check matching.

`checkSuites[].detailsUrl` string

Optional link to the provider's suite-level results.

`checkSuites[].createdAt` string

RFC 3339 suite creation timestamp.

Service account variant of the actor. Set when a service account performed the action.

`checkSuites[].actor.serviceAccount.id` string

Public identifier for the service account.

`checkSuites[].actor.serviceAccount.type` string

Product or feature the service account acts for. Allowed values: `bugbot`, `automations`, `agent_serve`, `agent`, `grok_bot`, `env_builds`. Absent when the account no longer exists or Cursor doesn't describe it. New values can be added; treat an absent or unrecognized value as an account of a product you don't recognize, never as an error.

`checkSuites[].actor.serviceAccount.displayName` string

Product name Cursor shows for the service account: `Cursor` for Cursor's own managed accounts, or a Grok bot's name. Never empty when present; a Grok bot whose name can't be read is named `Grok Bot`. Omitted when the account has no product name.

## Commits and contents

A commit separates git-object metadata under `commit` from top-level repository relationships. List responses omit `stats`; [Get Commit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-commit) includes whole-commit aggregate `stats`. Changed files are returned only by the paginated [List Commit Files](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-commit-files) collection. `author` and `committer` are git identities recorded in the commit, not Origin user objects.

A comparison is a summary only: it never embeds commit lists or file diffs. `status` is exactly `identical`, `ahead`, `behind`, or `diverged`; `aheadBy` and `behindBy` are commit counts. `baseCommit`, `headCommit`, and `mergeBaseCommit` use the sparse commit projection (no `stats` or files).

### List Commits

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/commits`

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists commits on a branch or starting ref.

List results omit `stats`. Use [Get Commit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-commit) for aggregate stats and [List Commit Files](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-commit-files) for the paginated file diff.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Query Parameters

`sha` string

SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic ref (for example `HEAD`) to start listing from. Empty means the repo's default branch.

`pageSize` integer

Max commits to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `nextPageToken`. Empty for the first page. Encodes the starting ref, walk position, and email and time filters; `sha`, `pageSize`, `authorEmails`, `committerEmails`, `since`, and `until` are ignored when a token is supplied. A filtered page can contain fewer than `pageSize` commits, or none, while `nextPageToken` is set. Keep paging until it is empty.

`authorEmails` array

Optional Git author email filter. Matches any listed email, case-insensitively after trimming whitespace. Blank entries and duplicates are ignored. At most 100 distinct emails; empty means no filter. These are Git author emails, not Origin actor IDs. Each page scans at most 1,000 commits for matches.

`committerEmails` array

Optional Git committer email filter. Uses the same normalization and 100-email limit as `authorEmails`; empty means no filter. When both filters are set, a commit must match both lists. Each page scans at most 1,000 commits for matches.

`since` string

Optional inclusive lower bound on committer time, as an RFC 3339 timestamp (for example `2026-08-01T00:00:00Z`): only commits committed at or after it are listed. Git records committer time in whole seconds, so fractional seconds are ignored, and a rebase or cherry-pick rewrites committer time but not author time. The listing ends once it reads 100 consecutive commits older than `since`, as `git log --since` does. The time filters share each page's 1,000-commit scan with the email filters. A malformed timestamp returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`until` string

Optional inclusive upper bound on committer time, as an RFC 3339 timestamp: only commits committed at or before it are listed. A malformed timestamp, or a `since` later than `until`, returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Response Fields

`commits` array

Sparse commits with no stats; changed files are not embedded.

`commits[].sha` string

Full commit SHA.

`commits[].commit` object

Git-object metadata nested separately from top-level repository relationships.

`commits[].commit.author` object

Name recorded in the Git identity.

`commits[].commit.committer.email` string

Email recorded in the Git identity.

`commits[].commit.committer.date` string

ISO-8601 timestamp preserving the git signature's original timezone offset (e.g. "2014-11-07T22:01:45+01:00").

```

### List Commit Files

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/commits/{sha}/files`

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists the files changed by a commit.

`sha` may be a commit SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic ref such as `HEAD`. Results default to 30 files and are capped at 100. A page token fixes the resolved commit and file cursor; on later requests, `sha` must match the token. Each file includes `filename`, `status`, `additions`, `deletions`, `changes`, `patch`, and `previousFilename` when renamed or copied. `patch` is empty for binary files.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`sha` string Required

SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic ref (for example `HEAD`) of the commit whose files should be listed. An abbreviated SHA resolves the same way as on [Get Git Commit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-git-commit).

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Max changed files to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page. The token fixes the resolved commit and file cursor, so `sha` on a follow-up request must match the token. `pageSize` on a follow-up request applies to that page; omit it to keep the previous page size.

#### Response Fields

`files` array

Paginated changed files with filename, status, line counts, patch, and previousFilename for renamed or copied files. Binary patches are empty.

`files[].filename` string

Path of the changed file.

`files[].status` string

Change status; added, removed, modified, renamed, or copied.

`files[].additions` integer

Added line count for the file.

`files[].deletions` integer

Deleted line count for the file.

`files[].changes` integer

Total changed line count for the file.

`files[].patch` string

Unified patch; empty for binary files.

`files[].previousFilename` string

Previous path when the file was renamed or copied.

`nextPageToken` string

Token fixes the resolved commit and file cursor; subsequent sha values must match it.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/commits/SHA/files' \

Compares commits, refs, or tags relative to their merge base. `basehead` is `"{base}...{head}"`; refs containing "/" must use their SHA.

`base` and `head` may each be a SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic ref such as `HEAD`. The response is an unpaginated summary: `status` is `identical`, `ahead`, `behind`, or `diverged`; the three commit objects are sparse and omit `stats` and files. No `totalCommits`, embedded `commits`, or `files` fields are returned. Unrelated histories return `404`.

### List Comparison Files

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/compare/{basehead}/files`

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists the files changed by a comparison: the diff of `head` against the merge base of `base` and `head`.

`basehead` is `"{base}...{head}"`; refs containing "/" must use their SHA. The file list always agrees with the summary from [Compare Commits](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#compare-commits), so an `identical` or `behind` comparison returns an empty list, and unrelated histories return `404`. Results default to 30 files and are capped at 100. Each file carries the same fields as [List Commit Files](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-commit-files).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`basehead` string Required

`"{base}...{head}"`, where either revision may be a SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic ref such as `HEAD`.

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Max changed files to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page. The token is bound to the resolved comparison and file cursor, so `basehead` on a follow-up request must match the token. Origin re-resolves the comparison on every page; when its commits have moved since the token was issued, the request returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) and listing must restart from the first page. `pageSize` on a follow-up request applies to that page; omit it to keep the previous page size.

#### Response Fields

`files` array

Paginated changed files with filename, status, line counts, patch, and previousFilename for renamed or copied files. Binary patches are empty.

`files[].filename` string

Path of the changed file.

`files[].status` string

Change status; added, removed, modified, renamed, or copied.

`files[].additions` integer

Added line count for the file.

`files[].deletions` integer

Deleted line count for the file.

`files[].changes` integer

Total changed line count for the file.

`files[].patch` string

Unified patch; empty for binary files.

`files[].previousFilename` string

Previous path when the file was renamed or copied.

`nextPageToken` string

Opaque cursor for the next page; empty when there are no more files.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/compare/BASE...HEAD/files' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

  "files": [
    {
      "filename": "src/telemetry.ts",
      "status": "modified",
      "additions": 6,

    }
  ]
}
```

### Get Contents

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/contents`

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns file or directory contents at a ref. The file path is passed as the `path` query parameter (supports nested paths); omit or leave empty for the repository root directory. Files larger than 1 MiB (decoded) are rejected with `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

Files contain base64 content. Directories contain immediate children in `entries`. Directory entries are sparse children containing `type`, `name`, `path`, `sha`, and `size`; fetch a child path to read its content.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Query Parameters

`path` string

Path to the file or directory relative to the repository root. Empty requests the root directory.

`ref` string

Commit, branch, tag, or symbolic ref (for example `HEAD`) to read from. Empty means the repository's default branch.

#### Response Fields

`type` string

Content kind; file or dir.

`encoding` string

File encoding; file responses use base64.

`size` string

Decoded content size in bytes, encoded as a JSON string under the API's 64-bit integer convention. File payloads larger than 1 MiB are rejected.

`name` string

Base name of the file or directory.

`path` string

Path relative to the repository root.

`sha` string

Blob SHA for a file or tree SHA for a directory.

`content` string

Base64-encoded file body; present for a fetched file.

`entries` array

Immediate sparse children of a directory. Entries contain type, name, path, sha, and size; fetch a child path to read its content.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/contents' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "type": "file",
  "encoding": "base64",
  "size": "312",
  "name": "telemetry.ts",
  "path": "src/telemetry.ts",
  "sha": "c9d8e7f6a5b4c3d2e1f0a9b8c7d6e5f4a3b2c1d0",
  "content": "Y29uc29sZS5sb2coImxhdW5jaCIpOwo="
}
```

### Batch Get Contents

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/contents:batchGet`

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns the contents of several explicit paths at a ref in one request. Each requested path yields a result marking whether it was found; a found path carries the same `Content` shape as `GetContents` (files as base64, directories as immediate `entries`, symlinks as files). Paths are matched exactly, with no globs or patterns, and at most 20 may be requested; duplicates are removed. Response results preserve first-seen request order. A single file larger than the [Get Contents](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-contents) 1 MiB cap fails the whole batch with `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400). Uses POST because the path list travels in the request body.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`paths` array Required

Exact paths to fetch, relative to the repository root (no globs or patterns). At most 20 entries; duplicates are removed. An empty string requests the repository root directory.

`ref` string

Commit, branch, tag, or symbolic ref (for example `HEAD`) to read from. Empty means the repository's default branch.

#### Response Fields

`results` array

One result per returned exact path, preserving first-seen request order.

`results[].path` string

Requested path corresponding to this result.

`results[].found` boolean

Whether the requested path exists at the resolved commit.

`results[].content` object

Content value when found is true; omitted when found is false.

`results[].content.type` string

Content kind; file or dir.

`results[].content.encoding` string

File encoding; file responses use base64.

`results[].content.size` string

Decoded content size in bytes, encoded as a JSON string under the API's 64-bit integer convention. File payloads larger than 1 MiB are rejected.

`results[].content.name` string

Base name of the file or directory.

`results[].content.path` string

Path relative to the repository root.

`results[].content.sha` string

Blob SHA for a file or tree SHA for a directory.

`results[].content.content` string

Base64-encoded file body; present for a fetched file.

`results[].content.entries` array

Immediate sparse children of a directory. Entries contain type, name, path, sha, and size; fetch a child path to read its content.

`resolvedCommitSha` string

Commit SHA to which the requested ref resolved.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/contents:batchGet' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \

}
```

### Grep Contents

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}:grep`

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Searches the text of the files in the repository at a ref and returns the lines that match, plus any requested surrounding context lines. The search is line-oriented: a pattern never matches across a line break, and each returned entry is one line. The repository is scanned for every request, so there is no pagination and no cursor; the response is complete only when `limitHit` is false. An empty repository with no refs returns no matches and `limitHit` false. Uses POST because the search parameters travel in the request body.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`ref` string

Commit, branch, tag, or symbolic ref (for example `HEAD`) to search. Empty means the repository's default branch.

`query` string Required

The pattern to search for. By default it is a regular expression supporting character classes, quantifiers, alternation, groups, and anchors; set `literal` to search for the text exactly instead. Whitespace is significant and is searched for as given. When `literal` is false, case-insensitive matching is a leading `(?i)` in the pattern (for example `(?i)launch`) and whole-word matching is `\b` around it (for example `\blaunch\b`). An empty pattern returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Maximum UTF-8 size: 4096 bytes.

`literal` boolean

Search for `query` as exact text rather than as a regular expression.

`caseInsensitive` boolean

Match upper and lower case as equivalent. Applied only when `literal` is true. Ignored for a regular-expression search; write a leading `(?i)` in `query` instead.

`wholeWord` boolean

Match only complete words. Applied only when `literal` is true. Ignored for a regular-expression search; write `\b` around the pattern instead.

`contextBefore` integer

How many lines immediately before each matching line to return as context. Values above 10 are reduced to 10.

`contextAfter` integer

How many lines immediately after each matching line to return as context. Values above 10 are reduced to 10.

`filterPath` string

Restrict the search to this file or directory, relative to the repository root. Empty searches the whole repository. Maximum UTF-8 size: 4096 bytes.

`includes` array

Glob patterns naming the paths to search. Matching is case-insensitive; a pattern containing no `/` matches at any depth, `*` matches within one path segment, and `**` matches across segments. When any include is present, a path matching none of them is not searched. At most 20 entries. Maximum UTF-8 size per pattern: 4096 bytes.

`excludes` array

Glob patterns naming paths to leave out, in the same syntax as `includes`. An exclude beats an include, and excluding a directory leaves out everything beneath it. At most 20 entries. Maximum UTF-8 size per pattern: 4096 bytes.

`maxResults` integer

The most matching occurrences to return. Zero requests the default of 1000, and values above 1000 are reduced to 1000. Context lines do not count toward the cap.

#### Response Fields

`matches` array

The matching lines and their context lines. The order in which files and lines appear is unspecified and can differ between identical requests.

`matches[].path` string

Path to the file, relative to the repository root.

`matches[].lineNumber` integer

One-based line number of this line within the file.

`matches[].line` string

The line's text, without its trailing line terminator.

`matches[].kind` string

Whether this line carries matches or was returned as context. Allowed values: `match`, `context`.

`matches[].submatches` array

Where the matches sit inside `line`. Always empty on a context line. When `limitHit` is true, the last matching line can carry only some of its matches. Ranges that fall entirely past `line` are omitted, and ranges that would extend past `line` are reduced to the bytes that remain.

`matches[].submatches[].start` integer

Byte offset of the first byte of the match within the line.

`matches[].submatches[].end` integer

Byte offset one past the last byte of the match within the line.

`limitHit` boolean

Whether the search reached `maxResults`. Narrow `query`, `filterPath`, or the glob lists to search a smaller set of files.

## Git data

Low-level git objects. Reads need `repository:contents:read`, and an empty repository returns `409`. [Create Commit From Files](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-commit-from-files) and [Create Git Ref](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-git-ref) write git objects and need `repository:contents:write`.

Besides branches and tags, [Get Git Ref](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-git-ref) reads a pull request's merge preview at `pull/{pullNumber}/merge` (normalized to `refs/pull/{pullNumber}/merge`): a commit that merges the pull request's current head into the tip of its base branch as of the last refresh. Origin refreshes it when the pull request is created, when its head is pushed, when it is retargeted, and when it is reopened, before the matching `pull_request.*` webhook events are published and within a bounded time budget; a refresh that does not finish in time leaves the previous ref in place, and the events still publish. Origin does not refresh it because the base branch advanced on its own, and it deletes the ref when the merge has conflicts and when the pull request closes or merges, so a `404` on an open pull request means conflicts or a preview not yet prepared. [Prepare Pull Request Merge Ref](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#prepare-pull-request-merge-ref) brings it up to date with the base branch's current tip. Each pull request version also reports its own test merge in `version.potentialMergeCommit`, whose `state` tells those two cases apart; see [Pull requests](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#pull-requests). The pull request's `mergeCommitSha` is a different commit, set only once it has merged.

### Get Blob

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns a Git blob object by SHA. Default response is JSON with MIME-wrapped base64 `content`. Pass `Accept: application/vnd.origin.raw+json` (or `application/vnd.origin.raw`) on the REST surface to receive raw blob bytes instead. Blobs larger than 4 MiB (decoded) are rejected; fetch larger files by cloning the repository over [Git HTTPS](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#git-https-authentication). Empty repositories return 409 Conflict.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`sha` string Required

Full or abbreviated hex SHA of the blob object.

#### Response Fields

`sha` string

Git blob object SHA.

`size` integer

Decoded blob size as a JSON number; blobs larger than 4 MiB are rejected by the JSON endpoint.

`encoding` string

JSON blob responses use base64 encoding.

`content` string

Base64-encoded blob bytes; callers may request raw bytes with Accept: application/vnd.origin.raw.

### Get Git Commit

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/git/commits/{sha}`

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns a Git commit object by SHA (or resolvable revision). This is the low-level Git Database commit shape (flat author/message/tree), not the higher-level `GetCommit` resource under `/commits/{sha}`. `sha` accepts a commit SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic ref such as `HEAD`. Empty repositories return 409 Conflict.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`sha` string Required

Full or abbreviated hex SHA of the commit object, or a branch, tag, or symbolic ref such as `HEAD`. An abbreviation needs at least 5 hex characters and is resolved among commit objects only; it fails when no commit or more than one commit carries it.

#### Response Fields

`sha` string

Full hex commit SHA.

`author` object

Author signature from the git object.

`author.name` string

Name recorded in the Git identity.

`author.email` string

Email recorded in the Git identity.

`author.date` string

ISO-8601 timestamp preserving the git signature's original timezone offset (e.g. "2014-11-07T22:01:45+01:00").

`committer` object

Committer signature from the git object.

`committer.name` string

Name recorded in the Git identity.

`committer.email` string

Email recorded in the Git identity.

`committer.date` string

ISO-8601 timestamp preserving the git signature's original timezone offset (e.g. "2014-11-07T22:01:45+01:00").

`message` string

Full commit message.

`tree` object

Tree this commit points at.

`tree.sha` string

SHA of the tree referenced by the commit.

`parents` array

Parent commit SHAs (empty for a root commit).

`parents[].sha` string

Parent commit SHA.

```

### Create Commit From Files

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/git/commits:createFromFiles`

Requires scope `repository:contents:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Creates a commit on a branch from inline file changes and advances the branch to it.

The changes apply to the tree at `expectedHeadSha`, which becomes the new commit's parent. A branch that has moved or does not exist, a set of changes that leaves the tree unchanged, a delete of a path the tree does not hold, a write a push ruleset blocks, and a repository whose contents are mirrored from another host each return `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

One request carries at most 1,000 file changes, 8 MiB per file, and 32 MiB of content in total. Exceeding a limit, repeating a path, or sending a malformed field returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400), with `google.rpc.BadRequest` field violations naming the offending `files[i]` entry.

The branch must already exist. Create it with [Create Git Ref](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-git-ref) first, then commit onto it.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`targetBranch` string Required

Branch that receives the commit, as `<branch>`, `heads/<branch>`, or `refs/heads/<branch>`. The branch must already exist. `HEAD` is rejected in every spelling.

`expectedHeadSha` string Required

Full hex SHA the target branch must currently point at. It becomes the new commit's parent. The all-zeros SHA is rejected.

`message` string Required

Commit message.

`author` object Required

Commit author. Timestamps are assigned by the server. Origin drops `<`, `>`, and newline characters from `name` and `email`, as `git commit` does, and a value with nothing left returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`author.name` string Required

Name recorded in the Git identity.

`author.email` string Required

Email recorded in the Git identity.

`committer` object

Commit committer. Defaults to `author` when omitted. Its `name` and `email` are cleaned the same way as `author`'s.

`committer.name` string

Name recorded in the Git identity. Required when `committer` is present.

`committer.email` string

Email recorded in the Git identity. Required when `committer` is present.

`files` array Required

File changes applied to the branch tip's tree. At least one change is required, and paths must be unique within a request.

`files[].path` string Required

Repository-relative path using `/` separators, for example `docs/changelog.md`.

`files[].content` string

New file contents, encoded per `files[].encoding`. Creates the file or replaces its contents. Set exactly one of `files[].content` and `files[].delete`.

`files[].delete` boolean

Removes the file. Must be `true` when set. Set exactly one of `files[].content` and `files[].delete`.

`files[].encoding` string

Encoding of `files[].content`. Allowed values: `utf-8` (default), `base64`. Ignored for a delete.

`files[].mode` string

File mode for `files[].content`. Allowed values: `file` (default), `executable`, `symlink`, where the contents are the link target. Ignored for a delete.

#### Response Fields

`sha` string

SHA of the new commit, now the branch tip.

`treeSha` string

SHA of the new commit's root tree.

`previousHeadSha` string

Branch tip before the write; the new commit's parent.

```

### Get Git Ref

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/git/ref/{ref}`

Requires scope `repository:contents:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns a single Git reference by name. `ref` is typically `heads/<branch>` or `tags/<tag>` (with or without a leading `refs/`), or the symbolic `HEAD`. Exact match only; use ListMatchingGitRefs for prefixes. Empty repositories return 409 Conflict.

`pull/<number>/merge` is a pull request's merge preview: a commit that merges its current head into the tip of its base branch as of the last refresh. It is a different commit from the pull request's `mergeCommitSha`, which is set only once the pull request has merged. The pull request's `version.potentialMergeCommit` reports the test merge per version: while a version is the latest and its `state` is `prepared`, its `sha` is the commit this ref points at.

Origin refreshes the preview when a pull request is created, when its head is pushed, when it is retargeted, and when it is reopened, before the matching `pull_request.*` webhook events publish and within a bounded time budget. A refresh that does not finish in time leaves the previous ref in place, and the events still publish. Origin does not refresh it because the base branch merely advanced, and it deletes the ref when the merge has conflicts and when the pull request closes or merges, so a `404` on an open pull request means the merge conflicts or the preview is not prepared yet. To bring it up to date with the base branch's current tip, call [Prepare Pull Request Merge Ref](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#prepare-pull-request-merge-ref).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`ref` string Required

Git reference name. Typically `heads/<branch>` or `tags/<tag>`; a leading `refs/` is accepted and normalized. The symbolic `HEAD` is also accepted (returned as `ref: "HEAD"` with the tip commit), as is `pull/<number>/merge` for a pull request's merge preview. Exact match on the full ref name.

#### Response Fields

`ref` string

Full ref name, e.g. "refs/heads/main".

`object` object

Object this ref points at directly (unpeeled). For annotated tags, `object.type` is "tag" and `object.sha` is the tag object SHA.

`object.sha` string

Hex SHA of the target object.

`object.type` string

One of "commit", "tree", "blob", or "tag".

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/git/ref/REF' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "ref": "refs/heads/main",
  "object": {
    "sha": "9a41f0c3d2b8e7f6a5c4d3e2f1b0a9c8d7e6f5a4",
    "type": "commit"
  }
}
```

### Create Git Ref

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/git/refs`

Requires scope `repository:contents:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Creates a branch reference pointing at an existing commit.

Only branch references can be created. A tag or any other reference namespace, and a `sha` that is not the full hex SHA of a commit in the repository, return `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Creating a branch that already points at `sha` succeeds and returns the existing reference; a branch that exists at any other commit returns `AlreadyExists` (HTTP 409 Conflict). A create a push ruleset blocks, or one on a repository whose contents are mirrored from another host, returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`ref` string Required

Branch reference to create, as `refs/heads/<branch>` or `heads/<branch>`.

`sha` string Required

Full hex SHA of an existing commit that the new branch points at.

#### Response Fields

`ref` string

Full ref name, e.g. "refs/heads/main".

`object` object

Object this ref points at directly (unpeeled). For a branch, `object.type` is "commit".

`object.sha` string

Hex SHA of the target object.

`object.type` string

One of "commit", "tree", "blob", or "tag".

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/git/refs' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "ref": "refs/heads/feature/login",
  "sha": "9a41f0c3d2b8e7f6a5c4d3e2f1b0a9c8d7e6f5a4"
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "ref": "refs/heads/feature/login",
  "object": {
    "sha": "9a41f0c3d2b8e7f6a5c4d3e2f1b0a9c8d7e6f5a4",
    "type": "commit"
  }
}
```

### Delete Git Ref

DELETE

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/git/refs/{ref}`

Requires scope `repository:contents:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Deletes a branch reference. The response body is empty.

Only branch references can be deleted. A branch that does not exist returns `404`. The repository default branch, a branch a deletion rule protects, and a repository whose contents are mirrored from another host return `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400). Pull requests whose head is the deleted branch are closed, as after a pushed deletion. A branch whose tip moves while the delete is in flight fails with `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400) or `Aborted` (HTTP 409 Conflict); retry to delete the new tip.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`ref` string Required

Branch reference to delete, as `refs/heads/<branch>` or `heads/<branch>`.

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/git/refs/REF' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

`sha` string Required

Tree SHA, commit SHA, branch, tag, or symbolic ref such as `HEAD`.

#### Query Parameters

`recursive` boolean

When true, returns the full recursive walk of the tree. Query values `true` and `1` enable recursion; omitting the parameter or passing any other value (including `false` and `0`) lists immediate children only.

## Grants

A grant binds one principal to one repository or one owner with one permission. These endpoints read, set, and remove the grants held directly on a resource, so access changes can be scripted and reviewed like code. Writes reuse the checks behind the Codebase permissions UI and record the same `repository.access_changed` and `namespace.access_changed` audit events. For the principal kinds, the two permission ladders, and how owner-level grants interact with repository-level ones, read [Origin Grants API](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/grants-api.md).

### List Repository Grants

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/grants`

Requires scope `repository:settings:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists the users, groups, and owning-team groups holding a permission granted directly on a repository. Permissions inherited from the repository's owner are not included.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Max grants to return. Defaults to 30 when unset or 0. Values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page. `pageSize` on a follow-up request applies to that page; omit it to keep the previous page size.

#### Response Fields

`grants` array

Grants held directly on the repository, ordered by principal kind (groups, owning-team admins, owning-team members, users) and then by id. A principal that no longer resolves to an active user, group, or owning team is omitted, so a page can hold fewer than `pageSize` grants.

`grants[].user` object

A user principal. Exactly one of `user`, `group`, or `teamGroup` is present.

`grants[].user.id` string

Public identifier for the user, prefixed `user_`.

`grants[].user.email` string

Email address of the user.

`grants[].user.displayName` string

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`grants[].user.handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle, without the `@` prefix. Present only while that profile is publicly visible; omitted otherwise.

`grants[].group` object

A Cursor group principal: a group the owner's team owns, or a group in that team's organization.

`grants[].group.id` string

Public identifier for the group, prefixed `grp_`.

`grants[].teamGroup` object

One of the owning team's built-in groups, granted on the repository itself and distinct from the one inherited from the owner.

`grants[].teamGroup.kind` string

Which built-in group holds the grant. Allowed values: `members`, `admins`.

### Upsert Repository Grant

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/grants`

Requires scope `repository:settings:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Sets the permission a user, group, or owning-team group holds directly on a repository, replacing any permission granted directly to that principal before. Repeating a grant the principal already holds succeeds without change. A user must be an active member of the repository owner's team or organization. A group must be one the owner's team owns, or an active group in that team's organization; otherwise the request returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`user` object

A user principal. Exactly one of `user`, `group`, or `teamGroup` is present.

`user.id` string

Public identifier for the user, prefixed `user_`.

`user.email` string

Email address of the user.

`user.displayName` string

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`user.handle` string

`group` object

A Cursor group principal: a group the owner's team owns, or a group in that team's organization.

`group.id` string

Public identifier for the group, prefixed `grp_`.

`teamGroup` object

`teamGroup.kind` string

Which built-in group holds the grant. Allowed values: `members`, `admins`.

`permission` string Required

Permission to grant. Allowed values: `read`, `write`, `admin`. `custom` returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400); custom policies are outside this API.

}
```

### Delete Repository Grant

DELETE

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/grants`

Requires scope `repository:settings:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Removes the permission a user, group, or owning-team group holds directly on a repository.

### List Namespace Grants

GET

`/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/grants`

Requires scope `namespace:settings:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists who has been granted access to an owner: users, groups, and the owning team's built-in admin and member groups. Each grant carries the permission it confers on every repository under the owner. Grants made on individual repositories are not included; read those with [List Repository Grants](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-repository-grants).

#### Path Parameters

`namespaceSlug` string Required

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `next_page_token`. Empty for the first page. `pageSize` on a follow-up request applies to that page; omit it to keep the previous page size.

#### Response Fields

`grants` array

Grants on this page. Admin grants come first; within each run, grants are ordered by principal kind (groups, owning-team admins, owning-team members, users) and then by id. A principal that no longer resolves to an active user, group, or owning team is omitted, so a page can hold fewer than `pageSize` grants.

`grants[].user` object

`grants[].user.id` string

Public identifier for the user, prefixed `user_`.

`grants[].user.email` string

Public identifier for the group, prefixed `grp_`.

`grants[].teamGroup` object

One of the owning team's built-in groups: the team's default access to the owner.

`grants[].teamGroup.kind` string

Which built-in group holds the grant. Allowed values: `members`, `admins`.

`grants[].permission` string

Permission the principal holds on every repository under the owner. Allowed values: `PERMISSION_READ`, `PERMISSION_CONTRIBUTOR`, `PERMISSION_WRITE`, `PERMISSION_ADMIN`, `PERMISSION_CUSTOM`. `PERMISSION_CUSTOM` reports a custom policy, which [Upsert Namespace Grant](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#upsert-namespace-grant) does not accept.

`nextPageToken` string

Opaque cursor for the next page; empty when there are no more pages.

## Inbound IP allowlist

A namespace's inbound IP allowlist holds the addresses allowed to reach its repositories. While the namespace enforces the list and at least one entry is enabled, git over SSH and HTTPS, the API, and file downloads on the namespace's repositories accept a Cursor user's requests only from listed addresses. The list does not restrict requests made with an app JWT, an installation access token, an installation user token, or a service account. These endpoints read the list, turn enforcement on or off, add, update, and remove entries, and replace the whole entry set. Allowlists are available on team namespaces.

Each entry is an IPv4 or IPv6 address or CIDR range with its own opaque `id`. The entry endpoints address an entry by that ID as `entryId`, and the ID stays the same when [Update Inbound IP Allowlist Entry](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#update-inbound-ip-allowlist-entry) changes the entry's `cidr`. A namespace lists at most 1,000 entries, and a disabled entry stays listed but admits nothing.

Reading the list and its entries accepts installation and user tokens holding `namespace:settings:read`. Turning enforcement on or off and adding, updating, removing, and replacing entries take a Cursor user credential holding `namespace:settings:write`; app and installation tokens are not accepted. Enabling enforcement, an update, or a removal that would exclude the caller's own address returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400), and a write from a caller an enforced list already excludes returns `PermissionDenied` (HTTP 403).

### Get Inbound IP Allowlist

GET

`/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/inbound-ip-allowlist`

Requires scope `namespace:settings:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns the namespace's inbound IP allowlist: whether it is enforced and every entry, oldest first. The response is not paginated; a namespace lists at most 1,000 entries. Allowlists are available on team namespaces; any other namespace returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`namespaceSlug` string Required

Slug of the namespace whose allowlist to return.

#### Response Fields

`enabled` boolean

Whether the list is enforced. The list takes effect only while this is `true` and at least one entry is enabled; see [Update Inbound IP Allowlist](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#update-inbound-ip-allowlist).

`entries` array

Every entry, oldest first.

`entries[].id` string

Entry ID, which the entry endpoints take as `entryId`. It stays the same when the entry's CIDR changes.

`entries[].cidr` string

IPv4 or IPv6 address or CIDR range, spelled as it was submitted.

`entries[].description` string

Label for the entry, at most 255 characters.

`entries[].enabled` boolean

Whether the entry admits its addresses. A disabled entry stays listed but admits nothing.

`entries[].createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for when the entry was added.

`etag` string

Fingerprint of the entry set. It changes whenever an entry is added, updated, or removed; turning enforcement on or off doesn't change it. Pass it to [Replace Inbound IP Allowlist Entries](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#replace-inbound-ip-allowlist-entries) to reject the replace if the entries changed since this read.

```bash
curl --request GET \

    }
  ]
}
```

### Update Inbound IP Allowlist

PATCH

`/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/inbound-ip-allowlist`

Requires scope `namespace:settings:write` (user access token).

Turns enforcement of the namespace's inbound IP allowlist on or off and returns the allowlist. While the list is enforced and at least one entry is enabled, git over SSH and HTTPS, the API, and file downloads on the namespace's repositories accept a Cursor user's requests only from listed addresses; app JWTs, installation access tokens, installation user tokens, and service accounts are not restricted. Enabling a list that excludes the caller's own address returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400), and a caller the enforced list already excludes receives `PermissionDenied` (HTTP 403). Setting the current value succeeds without change.

The caller must be a Cursor user credential holding `namespace:settings:write`. App and installation tokens are not accepted.

#### Path Parameters

`namespaceSlug` string Required

Namespace slug.

#### Request Body

`enabled` boolean Required

`true` to enforce the namespace's inbound IP allowlist, `false` to stop enforcing it.

#### Response Fields

`enabled` boolean

Whether the list is enforced. The list takes effect only while this is `true` and at least one entry is enabled.

`entries` array

Every entry, oldest first.

`entries[].id` string

Entry ID, which the entry endpoints take as `entryId`. It stays the same when the entry's CIDR changes.

`entries[].cidr` string

IPv4 or IPv6 address or CIDR range, spelled as it was submitted.

`entries[].description` string

Label for the entry, at most 255 characters.

`entries[].enabled` boolean

Whether the entry admits its addresses. A disabled entry stays listed but admits nothing.

`entries[].createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for when the entry was added.

`etag` string

Fingerprint of the entry set. It changes whenever an entry is added, updated, or removed; turning enforcement on or off doesn't change it. Pass it to [Replace Inbound IP Allowlist Entries](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#replace-inbound-ip-allowlist-entries) to reject the replace if the entries changed since this read.

```bash

### Add Inbound IP Allowlist Entry

POST

`/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/inbound-ip-allowlist/entries`

Requires scope `namespace:settings:write` (user access token).

Adds an entry to the namespace's inbound IP allowlist and returns it.

The CIDR is stored as spelled, after trimming surrounding whitespace. A CIDR the namespace already lists with the same spelling returns `AlreadyExists` (HTTP 409 Conflict). A CIDR that does not parse, a range covering an entire address space (`/0`), or a list already holding 1,000 entries returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). While the list is enforced, a caller whose own address it excludes receives `PermissionDenied` (HTTP 403).

The caller must be a Cursor user credential holding `namespace:settings:write`. App and installation tokens are not accepted.

#### Path Parameters

`namespaceSlug` string Required

Namespace slug.

#### Request Body

`cidr` string Required

IPv4 or IPv6 address or CIDR range, for example `203.0.113.0/24`, `203.0.113.7`, or `2001:db8::/32`. Stored as spelled after trimming surrounding whitespace. A range covering an entire address space (`/0`) is rejected.

`description` string

Label for the entry, at most 255 characters.

`enabled` boolean

Whether the entry admits its addresses. Defaults to `true` when omitted.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Entry ID, which the entry endpoints take as `entryId`. It stays the same when the entry's CIDR changes.

`cidr` string

IPv4 or IPv6 address or CIDR range, spelled as it was submitted.

`description` string

Label for the entry, at most 255 characters.

`enabled` boolean

Whether the entry admits its addresses. A disabled entry stays listed but admits nothing.

`createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for when the entry was added.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/namespaces/NAMESPACE_SLUG/inbound-ip-allowlist/entries' \

### Delete Inbound IP Allowlist Entry

DELETE

`/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/inbound-ip-allowlist/entries/{entryId}`

Requires scope `namespace:settings:write` (user access token).

Removes an inbound IP allowlist entry by its ID. An ID the namespace does not list returns `404`. Removing the entry that admits the caller's own address from an enforced list returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400), and a caller the enforced list already excludes receives `PermissionDenied` (HTTP 403). The response body is empty.

The caller must be a Cursor user credential holding `namespace:settings:write`. App and installation tokens are not accepted.

#### Path Parameters

`namespaceSlug` string Required

Namespace slug.

`entryId` string Required

`id` of the entry to remove.

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/namespaces/NAMESPACE_SLUG/inbound-ip-allowlist/entries/ENTRY_ID' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

### Update Inbound IP Allowlist Entry

PATCH

`/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/inbound-ip-allowlist/entries/{entryId}`

Requires scope `namespace:settings:write` (user access token).

Updates an inbound IP allowlist entry by its ID.

Omitted fields keep their stored values, and a new `cidr` changes the entry's range and keeps its ID. An ID the namespace does not list returns `404`, and a `cidr` another entry already uses returns `AlreadyExists` (HTTP 409 Conflict). A change that would exclude the caller's own address from an enforced list returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400), and a caller the enforced list already excludes receives `PermissionDenied` (HTTP 403).

The caller must be a Cursor user credential holding `namespace:settings:write`. App and installation tokens are not accepted.

#### Path Parameters

`namespaceSlug` string Required

Namespace slug.

`entryId` string Required

`id` of the entry to change.

#### Request Body

`cidr` string

New CIDR for the entry, subject to the same rules as `cidr` on [Add Inbound IP Allowlist Entry](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#add-inbound-ip-allowlist-entry). Omit to leave unchanged.

`description` string

Label for the entry, at most 255 characters. Omit to leave unchanged.

`enabled` boolean

Whether the entry admits its addresses. Omit to leave unchanged.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Entry ID, which the entry endpoints take as `entryId`. It stays the same when the entry's CIDR changes.

`cidr` string

IPv4 or IPv6 address or CIDR range, spelled as it was submitted.

`description` string

Label for the entry, at most 255 characters.

`enabled` boolean

Whether the entry admits its addresses. A disabled entry stays listed but admits nothing.

`createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for when the entry was added.

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/namespaces/NAMESPACE_SLUG/inbound-ip-allowlist/entries/ENTRY_ID' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "cidr": "203.0.113.0/25",
  "description": "Office, east wing"
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "id": "nsip_01k2ja2000e0080000000000c4",
  "cidr": "203.0.113.0/25",

}
```

### Replace Inbound IP Allowlist Entries

POST

`/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/inbound-ip-allowlist/entries:replace`

Requires scope `namespace:settings:write` (user access token).

Replaces the namespace's allowlist entries with the full set you send and returns the allowlist.

Origin matches entries by `cidr` exactly as typed, after trimming surrounding whitespace. CIDRs aren't normalized, so `10.0.0.1/8` and `10.0.0.0/8` are different entries. A matched entry keeps its `id` and `createdAt` and takes the `description` and `enabled` you send, a new CIDR is added, and a stored entry you leave out is deleted. The call doesn't change whether the list is enforced; use [Update Inbound IP Allowlist](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#update-inbound-ip-allowlist) for that. The replace is all or nothing. In the response, kept entries come first, then new entries in request order.

Each call costs 10 points, however many entries it sends. To manage a large list, or to sync one from Terraform, send the whole set here instead of one call per entry.

The caller must be a Cursor user credential holding `namespace:settings:write` with admin permission on the namespace. App and installation tokens and service accounts are not accepted.

#### Path Parameters

`namespaceSlug` string Required

Namespace slug.

#### Request Body

`entries` array

The complete set of entries the list should hold, at most 1,000.

`entries[].cidr` string Required

IPv4 or IPv6 address or CIDR range, subject to the same rules as `cidr` on [Add Inbound IP Allowlist Entry](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#add-inbound-ip-allowlist-entry). Stored as typed after trimming, with no normalization. Each spelling can appear once.

`entries[].description` string

Label for the entry, at most 255 characters.

`entries[].enabled` boolean

Whether the entry admits its addresses. Defaults to `true` when omitted.

`etag` string

`etag` from a prior read of the allowlist. When set and the entries have changed since, the call returns `Aborted` (HTTP 409 Conflict) and changes nothing. Omit to replace whatever is stored.

`allowEmpty` boolean

Set to `true` to send an empty `entries`, which deletes every entry. Without it, an empty `entries` returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Response Fields

`allowlist` object

The allowlist after the replace, in the same shape [Get Inbound IP Allowlist](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-inbound-ip-allowlist) returns: `enabled`, `entries[]`, and the new `etag`.

`addedCount` integer

Entries added.

`updatedCount` integer

Stored entries whose `description` or `enabled` changed.

`removedCount` integer

Stored entries deleted because the request left them out.

`unchangedCount` integer

Stored entries kept as they were. All four counts are always present, including when they're `0`.

## Labels

A label definition belongs to one repository and is addressed by its name. Assigning labels to a pull request is a separate surface; see [Set Pull Request Labels](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#set-pull-request-labels).

### List Labels

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/labels`

Requires scope `repository:labels:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists the labels defined on a repository, ordered by name.

Page tokens are bound to the repository they were minted for. A token replayed against a different repository, or any other malformed token, returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Maximum labels to return. Defaults to 30 when omitted or zero; values above 100 are clamped to 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `nextPageToken`. Omit for the first page. `pageSize` on a follow-up request applies to that page; omit it to keep the previous page size.

#### Response Fields

`labels` array

Page of label definitions, ordered by name.

`labels[].id` string

Public identifier for the label.

`labels[].name` string

Label name, unique within the repository. Names address the label in the read and write endpoints.

`labels[].color` string

Six-character hex color without a leading `#`.

`labels[].description` string

Label description. Absent when the label has none.

`nextPageToken` string

Opaque cursor for the next page. Empty when there are no more results.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/labels' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "id": "lbl_01k2ja2000e0080000000000m1",
      "name": "bug",
      "color": "d73a4a",
      "description": "Something isn't working"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Create Label

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/labels`

Requires scope `repository:labels:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Creates a label on a repository.

A name already used by another label on the repository returns `AlreadyExists` (HTTP 409 Conflict). A `color` that is not six hexadecimal characters, a `name` longer than 50 characters, a `description` longer than 255 characters, or a `name` or `description` that contains a NUL character returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`name` string Required

Label name. Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed. Maximum length: 50 characters.

`color` string Required

Six-character hex color without a leading `#`. Uppercase input is stored lowercase.

`description` string

Label description. Maximum length: 255 characters.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Public identifier for the label.

`name` string

Label name, unique within the repository. Names address the label in the read and write endpoints.

`color` string

Six-character hex color without a leading `#`.

`description` string

Label description. Absent when the label has none.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/labels' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "bug",
  "color": "d73a4a",
  "description": "Something isn'\''t working"
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "id": "lbl_01k2ja2000e0080000000000m1",
  "name": "bug",
  "color": "d73a4a",
  "description": "Something isn't working"
}
```

### Get Label

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/labels/{labelName}`

Requires scope `repository:labels:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns a single repository label by name.

An unknown name returns `404`. An empty `labelName` returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`labelName` string Required

Label name. Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed before lookup.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Public identifier for the label.

`name` string

Label name, unique within the repository. Names address the label in the read and write endpoints.

`color` string

Six-character hex color without a leading `#`.

`description` string

Label description. Absent when the label has none.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/labels/LABEL_NAME' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'

  "id": "lbl_01k2ja2000e0080000000000m1",
  "name": "bug",
  "color": "d73a4a",
  "description": "Something isn't working"
}
```

### Delete Label

DELETE

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/labels/{labelName}`

Requires scope `repository:labels:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Deletes a repository label by name. The response body is empty.

Deleting a label also removes it from every pull request it was assigned to. An unknown name returns `404`. An empty `labelName` returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`labelName` string Required

Label name. Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed before lookup.

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/labels/LABEL_NAME' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

### Update Label

PATCH

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/labels/{labelName}`

Requires scope `repository:labels:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Updates a repository label identified by its current name.

Omitted fields are left unchanged, and a request that omits all three returns the label as it stands. Renaming to a name another label already uses returns `AlreadyExists` (HTTP 409 Conflict). A `color` that is not six hexadecimal characters, a `name` longer than 50 characters, a `description` longer than 255 characters, or a `name` or `description` that contains a NUL character returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). An unknown `labelName` returns `404`.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`labelName` string Required

Current label name. Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed before lookup.

#### Request Body

`name` string

New label name. Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed. Maximum length: 50 characters. Omit to leave unchanged.

`color` string

Six-character hex color without a leading `#`. Omit to leave unchanged.

`description` string

Label description. Maximum length: 255 characters. Omit to leave unchanged.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Public identifier for the label.

`name` string

Label name, unique within the repository. Names address the label in the read and write endpoints.

`color` string

Six-character hex color without a leading `#`.

`description` string

  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "color": "b60205"
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json

  "description": "Something isn't working"
}
```

## Pull requests

Closed or merged pull requests may additionally include `closedAt`, `mergedAt`, and `mergeCommitSha`. Treat `head.ref` and `base.ref` as opaque Origin ref strings; they may be short branch names or fully qualified `refs/heads/…` values.

`version` is the pull request's latest numbered revision. Origin records a new version when the head is pushed, when the pull request is retargeted to another base, and when a pull request is reopened after its head moved while it was closed, each with its own `headSha`, `baseSha`, and diff stats. A reopen that records a version sends [`pull_request.head_ref.pushed`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events), the same event a push sends. The base branch advancing on its own records nothing, so `version.baseSha` (and `base.sha`, which mirrors it) is the base tip as resolved when the version was recorded and can lag the branch's current tip until the next version is recorded. Read the branch's current tip with [Get Git Ref](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-git-ref).

`mergeCommitSha` is the commit the merge wrote to the base branch: set once merged, unset before. The pre-merge preview is the `pull/{pullNumber}/merge` ref, a different commit; see [Git data](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#git-data).

`version.potentialMergeCommit` reports Origin's test merge of that version: whether it is `prepared`, hit a `merge_conflict`, or is still `unknown`; the base branch tip `baseSha` the merge was attempted on; and, once prepared, the merge commit's `sha`. It describes that version only, so a merged pull request keeps reporting it. `pull_request.*` webhook payloads carry it as of the event. An event waits for the preparation only within a time budget, so it can say `unknown` where a later [Get Pull Request](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-pull-request) says `prepared`; re-read the pull request or wait for the next event.

Review `verdict` is `approve`, `request_changes`, or `comment`. `submittedAt` is absent for an unsubmitted draft review. `dismissal` is absent while the verdict remains active. Dismissed reviews remain visible in review listings. Reviews automatically superseded by a newer decision carry a server-generated message.

Comments expose a `thread` reference for grouping. Create-comment requests still accept the scalar `threadId` command parameter when replying. Resolve or reopen a thread with [Update Pull Request Thread](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#update-pull-request-thread).

### List Pull Requests

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists pull requests in a repo, optionally filtered by head branch, head commit, base branch, author, creation-time range, stack, labels, and state. Each pull request includes its assigned labels and, when it belongs to a stack, its `stack` membership.

Results are sorted by creation order or by last update, selected with `sortBy`, most recent first. Set `direction=asc` for the other order. Page tokens embed the sort and the filters they were minted under, so a token replayed under a different sort or filter set is rejected; restart pagination when either changes.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Query Parameters

`head` string

Optional exact branch (head-ref) filter. Omit to list across every branch.

`state` string

Lifecycle filter. Allowed values: `open` (the default), `closed`, `merged`, `all`. `closed` covers every pull request that is no longer open, merged ones included; `merged` narrows to the merged subset. Any other value returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`pageSize` integer

Maximum results to return. Defaults to 30; maximum 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `nextPageToken`. Omit it for the first page. `pageSize` on a follow-up request applies to that page; omit it to keep the previous page size.

`author` string

Optional author filter. Pass a public actor ID exactly as this endpoint returns it in `pullRequests[].author.user.id`, `pullRequests[].author.app.id`, or `pullRequests[].author.serviceAccount.id` (`user_…`, `app_…`, or `sa_…`), or the exact email address of a user. Email matching is case-insensitive. Apps and service accounts have no email identity, so only user authors can be selected that way. An author with no pull requests returns an empty list, as does an email that resolves to no single user. Any other value, including the shared `origin-cursor-managed-actor` ID, returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Filtering by email requires `repository:members:read` on the repository. Without it, an email returns `PermissionDenied` (HTTP 403), so filter by the author's ID instead.

`base` string

Optional exact base-branch filter. Accepts a short name (`main`) or a fully qualified ref (`refs/heads/main`). Omit to list across every base.

`direction` string

Sort direction along `sortBy`. `"desc"` is the default: with `sortBy=created` it returns the most recently created first, and with `sortBy=updated` the most recently updated first. `"asc"` reverses each. Any other value returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`since` string

Optional inclusive lower bound on creation time, as an RFC 3339 timestamp such as `2026-08-01T00:00:00Z`. Returns only pull requests created at or after that instant. A malformed timestamp returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`until` string

Optional inclusive upper bound on creation time, in the same RFC 3339 format as `since`. Returns only pull requests created at or before that instant. A malformed timestamp returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`sortBy` string

Sort key. Allowed values: `created` (creation order, the default) or `updated` (time of last update). Any other value returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`headSha` string

Optional head commit filter: the full 40- or 64-character hex SHA of a pull request head, matched case-insensitively. Selects a pull request when any of its recorded versions has that head commit, current or superseded, so compare `head.sha` on each result to tell the two apart. The other filters still apply, and `state` defaults to `open`, so pass `state=all` to reach merged and closed pull requests. Malformed, abbreviated, and unknown SHAs match nothing.

`stackId` string

Optional stack filter: a stack id as returned in `pullRequests[].stack.id`. Returns only that stack's members, in the requested sort order rather than stack order, so rebuild the stack from each member's `stack.parentPullRequest`. `state` still defaults to `open`, which excludes merged members; pass `state=all` for the whole stack. A well-formed id that names no stack in this repository returns an empty list, and any other value returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`labels` array

Optional label filter, in [preview](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#preview). Repeat the parameter once per label name, as in `labels=bug&labels=security`. A comma is part of the name, so `labels=bug,security` names a single label. Returns only pull requests that carry every named label. Origin trims whitespace around each name and counts a repeated name once. Omit the parameter, or pass only blank values, for no filter. More than 10 names, a name longer than 50 characters, or a name that isn't a label in this repository returns an empty list. The other filters still apply, and `state` still defaults to `open`.

New values can be added; treat an absent or unrecognized value as an account of a product you don't recognize, never as an error.

`pullRequests[].author.serviceAccount.displayName` string

Product name Cursor shows for the service account: `Cursor` for Cursor's own managed accounts, or a Grok bot's name. Never empty when present; a Grok bot whose name can't be read is named `Grok Bot`. Omitted when the account has no product name.

`pullRequests[].createdAt` string

RFC 3339 pull request creation timestamp.

`pullRequests[].updatedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for the latest pull request update.

`pullRequests[].closedAt` string

RFC 3339 close timestamp; may appear on closed or merged pull requests.

`pullRequests[].mergedAt` string

RFC 3339 merge timestamp; may appear on merged pull requests.

`pullRequests[].mergeCommitSha` string

SHA of the commit the merge wrote to the base branch. Set once the pull request merges and absent before. The pre-merge preview is a different commit, read through the `pull/<number>/merge` ref with [Get Git Ref](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-git-ref).

`pullRequests[].additions` integer

Added lines in the current pull request version.

`pullRequests[].deletions` integer

Deleted lines in the current pull request version.

`pullRequests[].changedFiles` integer

Changed file count in the current pull request version.

Six-character hex color without a leading `#`.

`pullRequests[].labels[].description` string

Label description. Absent when the label has none.

`pullRequests[].stack` object

Stack membership: the chain of dependent pull requests this one belongs to, each stacked on the one it builds upon. Absent when the pull request is not part of a stack.

`pullRequests[].stack.id` string

Stable stack identifier, shared by every member of the stack. Pass it as `stackId` to [List Pull Requests](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-pull-requests) to read the other members.

`pullRequests[].stack.parentPullRequest` object

The pull request this one is stacked on. Absent on the root of the stack. A merged parent stays referenced until the child is retargeted or re-parented.

`pullRequests[].stack.parentPullRequest.id` string

Stable Origin identifier of the parent pull request.

`pullRequests[].stack.parentPullRequest.number` string

Repository-local number of the parent pull request, encoded as a JSON string.

`pullRequests[].stack.parentPullRequest.repository` object

Repository the parent belongs to, carrying the same `id`, `name`, and `owner` fields as a check run's `repository`. Stacks never cross repositories, so this is always the pull request's own repository.

`pullRequests[].webUrl` string

Output-only web URL for this pull request on Cursor. Absent when Origin can't form a link for it.

`pullRequests[].version` object

Current numbered pull request version and its head/base SHAs.

`pullRequests[].version.number` string

Monotonic pull request version number encoded as a JSON string.

`pullRequests[].version.headSha` string

Head SHA captured by this pull request version.

`pullRequests[].version.baseSha` string

Base SHA captured by this pull request version.

`pullRequests[].version.createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for creation of this pull request version.

`pullRequests[].version.potentialMergeCommit` object

Origin's test merge of this version, a commit that merges its `headSha` onto the base branch tip, and how far its preparation got. Present on every version. It describes this version only and stays readable after the pull request merges; it is a different commit from `mergeCommitSha`. For a stacked pull request the base branch is the parent's branch, so the test merge covers only this pull request's changes on top of it.

`pullRequests[].version.potentialMergeCommit.state` string

How far the test merge's preparation got. Allowed values: `unknown`, `prepared`, `merge_conflict`. `unknown` means the test merge is not prepared: the version is waiting for its preparation, or the preparation timed out or failed. Every new version starts as `unknown`, so it never carries another version's commit. `prepared` means the test merge exists and `sha` and `baseSha` describe it. `merge_conflict` means merging `headSha` onto the base branch tip in `baseSha` conflicted, so there is no test merge; it is the condition [Get Pull Request Mergeability](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-pull-request-mergeability) reports as a `merge_conflict` blocker, and reopening the pull request prepares the version again. Treat an unrecognized value as `unknown`.

`pullRequests[].version.potentialMergeCommit.sha` string

SHA of the two-parent test-merge commit: its first parent is this object's `baseSha` and its second parent is the version's `headSha`. Present only when `state` is `prepared`. The `pull/{pullNumber}/merge` ref points at it while this version is the latest. After that it stays readable by SHA through [Get Commit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-commit), but it cannot be fetched by SHA over Git.

`pullRequests[].version.potentialMergeCommit.baseSha` string

Base branch tip Origin merged `headSha` onto when it prepared this version: the test merge's first parent when `state` is `prepared`, and the tip the merge conflicted with when `state` is `merge_conflict`. Absent when `state` is `unknown`, and on a `merge_conflict` recorded before Origin reported this field for conflicts. It can be newer than `pullRequests[].version.baseSha`, and Origin does not refresh it when the base branch merely advances.

`nextPageToken` string

Opaque continuation token returned by a list response; an empty string means there is no next page. Do not inspect or construct it, and restart pagination when repository or filters change.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls' \

### Create Pull Request

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Creates a pull request from `head` into `base`.

Optional `parent_pull_number` stacks this change on another open or draft pull request in the same repository.

A `title` longer than 256 characters, or a `body` longer than 65,536 characters, returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Both limits count Unicode code points.

A `head` with no history in common with `base` returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) and creates nothing. If a later push leaves an open pull request's head disjoint from its base, Origin closes the pull request and delivers [`pull_request.closed`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events); a subsequent related push does not reopen it.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`title` string Required

Pull request title. Maximum length: 256 characters.

`body` string

Pull request body / description. Can be empty. Maximum length: 65,536 characters.

`head` string Required

Source branch name (the head of the change). Must resolve in the repo at call time.

`base` string Required

Target branch name (what the change merges into). Must name a branch that exists in the repo at call time. A commit SHA, a tag name, or a branch that does not exist returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`draft` boolean

When true, create as a draft. When false or omitted, create as open (ready for review).

`parentPullRequest` object

Optional stack parent: another open or draft pull request in the same repository. Set exactly one member. An empty selector, more than one member, or `clear` returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`parentPullRequest.number` string

Parent pull request number within the repository.

`parentPullRequest.id` string

Parent pull request id, as returned in `id`.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Stable Origin pull request identifier.

`number` string

Repository-local pull request number encoded as a JSON string.

`state` string

Pull request state; open or closed. Merged pull requests are closed with merged set true.

`draft` boolean

Whether the pull request is a draft.

`merged` boolean

Whether the pull request has merged.

`title` string

Pull request title.

`body` string

Pull request description body.

`head` object

The source side of the change - what is being merged in.

`head.ref` string

The ref this side points at, as Origin records it.

`head.sha` string

Tip commit SHA of this side at the change's latest version.

`base` object

The target side of the change — what it merges into.

`base.ref` string

The ref this side points at, as Origin records it.

`base.sha` string

Tip commit SHA of this side at the change's latest version.

`author` object

Public actor that opened the pull request.

`author.user` object

User variant of the actor. Set when a user performed the action.

`author.user.id` string

Public identifier for the user.

`author.user.email` string

Email address of the user. Always set when the user variant is present.

`author.user.displayName` string

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`author.user.handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle, without the `@` prefix. Present only while that profile is publicly visible; omitted otherwise.

`author.app` object

App variant of the actor. Set when an app performed the action.

`author.app.id` string

Public identifier for the app.

`author.app.displayName` string

The app's registered display name. Omitted when the app cannot be resolved and on Cursor's first-party managed actor.

`author.serviceAccount` object

Service account variant of the actor. Set when a service account performed the action.

`author.serviceAccount.id` string

Public identifier for the service account.

`author.serviceAccount.type` string

Product or feature the service account acts for. Allowed values: `bugbot`, `automations`, `agent_serve`, `agent`, `grok_bot`, `env_builds`. Absent when the account no longer exists or Cursor doesn't describe it. New values can be added; treat an absent or unrecognized value as an account of a product you don't recognize, never as an error.

`author.serviceAccount.displayName` string

Product name Cursor shows for the service account: `Cursor` for Cursor's own managed accounts, or a Grok bot's name. Never empty when present; a Grok bot whose name can't be read is named `Grok Bot`. Omitted when the account has no product name.

`createdAt` string

RFC 3339 pull request creation timestamp.

`updatedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for the latest pull request update.

`closedAt` string

RFC 3339 close timestamp; may appear on closed or merged pull requests.

`mergedAt` string

RFC 3339 merge timestamp; may appear on merged pull requests.

`mergeCommitSha` string

SHA of the commit the merge wrote to the base branch. Set once the pull request merges and absent before. The pre-merge preview is a different commit, read through the `pull/<number>/merge` ref with [Get Git Ref](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-git-ref).

`additions` integer

Added lines in the current pull request version.

`deletions` integer

Deleted lines in the current pull request version.

`changedFiles` integer

Changed file count in the current pull request version.

`labels` array

Labels currently assigned to the pull request, sorted by name. Empty when none are assigned.

`labels[].id` string

Public identifier for the label.

`labels[].name` string

Label name, unique within the repository. Names address the label in the write endpoints.

`labels[].color` string

Six-character hex color without a leading `#`.

`labels[].description` string

Label description. Absent when the label has none.

`stack` object

Stack membership: the chain of dependent pull requests this one belongs to, each stacked on the one it builds upon. Absent when the pull request is not part of a stack.

`stack.id` string

Stable stack identifier, shared by every member of the stack. Pass it as `stackId` to [List Pull Requests](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-pull-requests) to read the other members.

`stack.parentPullRequest` object

The pull request this one is stacked on. Absent on the root of the stack. A merged parent stays referenced until the child is retargeted or re-parented.

`stack.parentPullRequest.id` string

Stable Origin identifier of the parent pull request.

`stack.parentPullRequest.number` string

Repository-local number of the parent pull request, encoded as a JSON string.

`stack.parentPullRequest.repository` object

Repository the parent belongs to, carrying the same `id`, `name`, and `owner` fields as a check run's `repository`. Stacks never cross repositories, so this is always the pull request's own repository.

`webUrl` string

Output-only web URL for this pull request on Cursor. Absent when Origin can't form a link for it.

`version` object

Current numbered pull request version and its head/base SHAs.

`version.number` string

Monotonic pull request version number encoded as a JSON string.

`version.headSha` string

Head SHA captured by this pull request version.

`version.baseSha` string

Base SHA captured by this pull request version.

`version.createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for creation of this pull request version.

`version.potentialMergeCommit` object

Origin's test merge of this version, a commit that merges its `headSha` onto the base branch tip, and how far its preparation got. Present on every version. It describes this version only and stays readable after the pull request merges; it is a different commit from `mergeCommitSha`. For a stacked pull request the base branch is the parent's branch, so the test merge covers only this pull request's changes on top of it.

`version.potentialMergeCommit.state` string

How far the test merge's preparation got. Allowed values: `unknown`, `prepared`, `merge_conflict`. `unknown` means the test merge is not prepared: the version is waiting for its preparation, or the preparation timed out or failed. Every new version starts as `unknown`, so it never carries another version's commit. `prepared` means the test merge exists and `sha` and `baseSha` describe it. `merge_conflict` means merging `headSha` onto the base branch tip in `baseSha` conflicted, so there is no test merge; it is the condition [Get Pull Request Mergeability](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-pull-request-mergeability) reports as a `merge_conflict` blocker, and reopening the pull request prepares the version again. Treat an unrecognized value as `unknown`.

`version.potentialMergeCommit.sha` string

SHA of the two-parent test-merge commit: its first parent is this object's `baseSha` and its second parent is the version's `headSha`. Present only when `state` is `prepared`. The `pull/{pullNumber}/merge` ref points at it while this version is the latest. After that it stays readable by SHA through [Get Commit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-commit), but it cannot be fetched by SHA over Git.

`version.potentialMergeCommit.baseSha` string

Base branch tip Origin merged `headSha` onto when it prepared this version: the test merge's first parent when `state` is `prepared`, and the tip the merge conflicted with when `state` is `merge_conflict`. Absent when `state` is `unknown`, and on a `merge_conflict` recorded before Origin reported this field for conflicts. It can be newer than `version.baseSha`, and Origin does not refresh it when the base branch merely advances.

### Update Pull Request

PATCH

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Updates a pull request's title, body, base branch, stack parent, and/or lifecycle state.

Omitted fields are unchanged. Present fields are applied in order: metadata, then reopen/draft/ready-for-review, then base, then stack parent, then close. Close runs last so a same-request retarget can still see an open change; reopen runs before base so a closed pull can be retargeted; the stack parent runs after base so an explicit parent wins over the one a base change derives. If a later step fails, earlier steps may already have been committed.

A `title` longer than 256 characters, or a `body` longer than 65,536 characters, returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Both limits count Unicode code points.

Reopening a closed pull request, with `state` set to `"open"` or `draft` set to `false`, requires its head branch and its base branch to exist. When either branch was deleted, the request returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400) and the pull request stays closed, even when the same request also sets `base`; push the branch again, then reopen the pull request. To merge it into another branch, send `base` once it's open.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

#### Request Body

`title` string

New title. Omitted fields are left unchanged. Maximum length: 256 characters.

`body` string

New body / description. An empty string clears the body. Maximum length: 65,536 characters.

`state` string

`"open"` or `"closed"`. `"closed"` closes the pull request. `"open"` without `draft: true` marks it ready for review, including publishing an existing draft. Reopening a pull request whose head moved while it was closed records a new `version` and sends [`pull_request.head_ref.pushed`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events). Merged is not writable; use `MergePullRequest`.

`draft` boolean

`true` marks the pull request draft; `false` marks it ready for review (and reopens it if currently closed, which can record a new `version`). Ignored when `state` is `"closed"`.

`base` string

New base branch. Retargets the pull request and can update stack parentage when the new base is another change's head (or the default branch). Must name a branch that exists in the repo at call time; a commit SHA, a tag name, or a branch that does not exist returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`parentPullRequest` object

Stack parent edit. Set exactly one member: `number` or `id` stacks this pull request on that parent, replacing any current parent, and `clear` removes the parent. Omit the field to leave the stack unchanged. An empty selector, `clear: false`, or more than one member returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). This is an association only: no branch is rewritten, and `base` is retargeted only when you send it too. Origin applies it after `base`, so an explicit parent wins over the one a base change derives.

`parentPullRequest.number` string

Parent pull request number within the repository.

`parentPullRequest.id` string

Parent pull request id, as returned in `id`.

`parentPullRequest.clear` boolean

Removes the current stack parent. Only `true` is accepted.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Stable Origin pull request identifier.

`number` string

Repository-local pull request number encoded as a JSON string.

`state` string

Pull request state; open or closed. Merged pull requests are closed with merged set true.

`author.app` object

App variant of the actor. Set when an app performed the action.

Public identifier for the app.

`author.app.displayName` string

The app's registered display name. Omitted when the app cannot be resolved and on Cursor's first-party managed actor.

Service account variant of the actor. Set when a service account performed the action.

`author.serviceAccount.id` string

Public identifier for the service account.

`author.serviceAccount.type` string

Product or feature the service account acts for. Allowed values: `bugbot`, `automations`, `agent_serve`, `agent`, `grok_bot`, `env_builds`. Absent when the account no longer exists or Cursor doesn't describe it. New values can be added; treat an absent or unrecognized value as an account of a product you don't recognize, never as an error.

`author.serviceAccount.displayName` string

Product name Cursor shows for the service account: `Cursor` for Cursor's own managed accounts, or a Grok bot's name. Never empty when present; a Grok bot whose name can't be read is named `Grok Bot`. Omitted when the account has no product name.

The pull request this one is stacked on. Absent on the root of the stack. A merged parent stays referenced until the child is retargeted or re-parented.

`stack.parentPullRequest.id` string

Stable Origin identifier of the parent pull request.

Treat an unrecognized value as `unknown`.

### List Pull Request Comments

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/comments`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists every comment on a pull request in chronological order, optionally bounded to a creation-time window. Each comment carries its full thread: id, diff anchor, and resolution state. Group the flat response by `thread.id` without a second request.

Page tokens embed the filters they were minted under, so a token replayed with different filters is rejected; restart pagination when a filter changes.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

#### Query Parameters

`pageSize` integer

Maximum comments to return. Defaults to 30; maximum 100.

`pageToken` string

Opaque cursor from a previous response's `nextPageToken`. Omit it for the first page. `pageSize` on a follow-up request applies to that page; omit it to keep the previous page size.

`since` string

Optional inclusive lower bound on comment creation time, as an RFC 3339 timestamp such as `2026-08-01T00:00:00Z`. Returns only comments created at or after that instant. A malformed timestamp returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`until` string

Optional inclusive upper bound on comment creation time, in the same RFC 3339 format as `since`. Returns only comments created at or before that instant. A malformed timestamp returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`threadIds` array

Optional thread IDs that restrict the listing to comments in those threads. Omit to return every comment on the pull request. Duplicates are ignored, so the limit of 20 applies to distinct IDs. A longer list, or an empty ID, returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Response Fields

`comments` array

Visible general and inline comments as one flat chronological list; group them by thread.id.

`comments[].id` string

Stable pull request comment identifier.

`comments[].thread` object

`comments[].thread.side` string

Diff side of the anchor. Allowed values: `left`, `right`. Unset for general-discussion threads.

`comments[].thread.startLine` integer

First line of the anchored range in the `side` version of the file. `0` for file-level and general-discussion threads.

`comments[].thread.endLine` integer

Inclusive last line of the anchored range. `0` when the anchor is a single line or has no line range.

`comments[].thread.resolvedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for when the thread was resolved. Unset while the thread is open.

`comments[].thread.createdAt` string

RFC 3339 thread creation timestamp.

App variant of the actor. Set when an app performed the action.

`comments[].author.app.id` string

Public identifier for the app.

`comments[].author.app.displayName` string

The app's registered display name. Omitted when the app cannot be resolved and on Cursor's first-party managed actor.

`comments[].author.serviceAccount` object

Service account variant of the actor. Set when a service account performed the action.

`comments[].author.serviceAccount.id` string

Public identifier for the service account.

`comments[].author.serviceAccount.type` string

Product or feature the service account acts for. Allowed values: `bugbot`, `automations`, `agent_serve`, `agent`, `grok_bot`, `env_builds`. Absent when the account no longer exists or Cursor doesn't describe it. New values can be added; treat an absent or unrecognized value as an account of a product you don't recognize, never as an error.

`comments[].author.serviceAccount.displayName` string

Product name Cursor shows for the service account: `Cursor` for Cursor's own managed accounts, or a Grok bot's name. Never empty when present; a Grok bot whose name can't be read is named `Grok Bot`. Omitted when the account has no product name.

`comments[].createdAt` string

RFC 3339 comment creation timestamp.

`comments[].updatedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for the latest comment edit.

`comments[].reactions` array

### Delete Pull Request Comment

DELETE

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/comments/{commentId}`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Deletes a pull request comment by its stable Origin id. The response body is empty.

The comment's author can always delete it. Any other caller must hold write access to the repository, which `repository:contents:write` grants, and otherwise receives `PermissionDenied` (HTTP 403). Deleting the last comment of a thread removes the thread; deleting any other comment, the thread opener included, leaves the thread and its remaining comments in place. Thread resolution is not a gate. Reactions to the comment and its edit history are removed with it.

An unknown id, an already-deleted comment, and a comment in another repository all return `404`. A malformed id returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`commentId` string Required

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/comments/COMMENT_ID' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

### Create Pull Request Comment

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/comments`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Creates a comment on an Origin pull request. The comment targets exactly one of four things: `threadId` replies to an existing thread, general-discussion and inline alike; `inline` opens a new thread anchored to a line range in the pull request version's diff; `file` opens a new thread on a whole file in that diff; supplying none of them opens a new general-discussion thread. Bodies longer than 65,536 characters are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

An `inline` anchor must reference the version's diff. The `path` must be part of that diff, and the `side` must have content there, so anchoring `left` on an added file or `right` on a deleted file is rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Any line of a changed file anchors, and the range is not restricted to the diff's hunks. The range must fit the file on the anchored side, which `left` reads at the base commit and `right` at the head: a range running past the last line is rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Origin never falls back to a general-discussion comment when an anchor is invalid.

A `file` anchor carries the path alone. Origin derives the side from the file's change kind, the base version for a deleted file and the head version otherwise, and returns it on `thread.side`. Send the deleted path for a deletion and the head path for every other change. A path outside the diff is rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400), as is a renamed file's pre-rename source path.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

#### Request Body

`body` string Required

Comment text. Maximum length: 65,536 characters, counted as Unicode code points.

`threadId` string

Existing thread id to reply to. Omit to open a new thread. Cannot be combined with `versionNumber`.

`inline` object

Diff anchor for a new inline thread. Cannot be combined with `threadId`.

`inline.path` string Required

File path in the pull request version's diff.

`inline.side` string Required

Diff side of the anchor. Allowed values: `left` for the base version of the file, `right` for the head version.

`inline.startLine` integer Required

First 1-based line of the anchored range in the `side` version of the file. The range must not run past the end of that file.

`inline.endLine` integer

Inclusive last line of the anchored range. Must be greater than or equal to `startLine`. Omit for a single-line anchor.

`file` object

Anchor for a new file-level thread on a whole file in the pull request version's diff. Cannot be combined with `threadId` or `inline`.

`file.path` string Required

File path in the pull request version's diff: the deleted path for a deletion, the head path otherwise.

`versionNumber` string

Pull request version number to file a new thread against. `0` or unset means the latest version at call time. Only meaningful for new threads.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Stable pull request comment identifier.

`thread` object

### Add Pull Request Comment Reaction

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/comments/{commentId}/reactions`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Adds the caller's reaction to a pull request comment. The response body is empty.

A caller holds at most one reaction of each emoji on a comment, so adding one the caller already holds succeeds without change and delivers no [`pull_request.comment.reaction.added`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events) event. With an installation access token, the caller is the installation's app.

A comment outside the repository in the path, or a pending-review comment not visible to the caller, returns `404`. A comment in the caller's own unsubmitted review returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`commentId` string Required

#### Request Body

`emoji` string Required

The emoji to place, such as `✅`, stored exactly as sent. At most 32 Unicode code points, with no control characters or unpaired surrogates; `.` and `..` are rejected. A missing or invalid value returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/comments/COMMENT_ID/reactions' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "emoji": "✅"
}'
```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

### Remove Pull Request Comment Reaction

DELETE

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/comments/{commentId}/reactions/{emoji}`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Removes the caller's reaction from a pull request comment. The response body is empty.

Removing a reaction the caller doesn't hold succeeds without change, and the same reaction placed by other principals is never affected. With an installation access token, the caller is the installation's app.

A comment outside the repository in the path, or a pending-review comment not visible to the caller, returns `404`. A comment in the caller's own unsubmitted review returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`commentId` string Required

`emoji` string Required

The emoji to remove, exactly as it appears in the comment's `reactions`, percent-encoded in the path: `✅` is `%E2%9C%85`.

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/comments/COMMENT_ID/reactions/%E2%9C%85' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

### Update Pull Request Thread

PATCH

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/threads/{threadId}`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Resolves or reopens a pull request comment thread and returns the thread's updated state. Resolving an already-resolved thread, or reopening an already-open one, is a no-op.

The thread must belong to the repository in the path; a thread stored on another repository returns `404`. Replying to a resolved thread with [Create Pull Request Comment](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-pull-request-comment) is allowed and does not reopen it.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`threadId` string Required

Stable Origin thread ID.

#### Request Body

`resolved` boolean Required

Target resolution state. `true` resolves the thread; `false` reopens it.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Stable identity of the thread. Group comments in one discussion by this value.

`version` object

Pull request version the thread was filed against, including its head and base SHAs. The anchor is fixed to this version and does not move as the pull request gains versions.

`version.number` string

Monotonic pull request version number encoded as a JSON string.

`version.headSha` string

Head SHA captured by this pull request version.

`version.baseSha` string

Base SHA captured by this pull request version.

`path` string

File path of the thread's diff anchor. Empty for general-discussion threads.

`side` string

Diff side of the anchor. Allowed values: `left`, `right`. Unset for general-discussion threads.

`startLine` integer

First line of the anchored range in the `side` version of the file. `0` for file-level and general-discussion threads.

`endLine` integer

Inclusive last line of the anchored range. `0` when the anchor is a single line or has no line range.

`resolvedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for when the thread was resolved. Unset while the thread is open.

`createdAt` string

RFC 3339 thread creation timestamp.

`updatedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for the latest thread update.

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/threads/THREAD_ID' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \

### List Pull Request Labels

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/labels`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists every label assigned to a pull request, ordered by name.

The response carries the full assigned list rather than a page of it, so this endpoint takes no pagination parameters. A pull request can have at most 100 labels. An unknown pull request returns `404`.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

#### Response Fields

`labels` array

Every label currently assigned to the pull request, sorted by name.

`labels[].id` string

Public identifier for the label.

`labels[].name` string

Label name, unique within the repository. Names address the label in the write endpoints.

`labels[].color` string

Six-character hex color without a leading `#`.

`labels[].description` string

Label description. Absent when the label has none.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/labels' \

    {
      "id": "lbl_01k2ja2000e0080000000000m1",
      "name": "bug",
      "color": "d73a4a",
      "description": "Something isn't working"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Set Pull Request Labels

PUT

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/labels`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Replaces every label assigned to a pull request with the labels you name.

An empty list removes every assigned label. The labels must already exist in the repository; an unknown name or an unknown pull request returns `404`. A pull request can have at most 100 labels, so naming more than 100 returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400). The response lists the labels assigned after the replacement, ordered by name.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

#### Request Body

`labels` array

Label names to assign. Maximum 100. An empty list removes every assigned label. Duplicate names are ignored.

#### Response Fields

`labels` array

Labels assigned after the replacement, ordered by name. Each entry carries `id`, `name`, `color`, and `description`.

```bash
curl --request PUT \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/labels' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "labels": [
    "bug"
  ]
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "id": "lbl_01k2ja2000e0080000000000m1",
      "name": "bug",
      "color": "d73a4a",
      "description": "Something isn't working"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Add Pull Request Labels

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/labels`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Adds existing repository labels to a pull request.

Labels already assigned to the pull request stay assigned. The labels must already exist in the repository; an unknown name or an unknown pull request returns `404`. The request must name between 1 and 100 labels, and a pull request can have at most 100 labels in total, so a request that would take it past that limit returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400). The response lists the labels you named, not the pull request's full set; read the full set with [List Pull Request Labels](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-pull-request-labels).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

#### Request Body

`labels` array Required

Label names to add. Maximum 100. Duplicate names are ignored.

#### Response Fields

`labels` array

Labels named in the request. Each entry carries `id`, `name`, `color`, and `description`.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/labels' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "labels": [
    "bug"
  ]
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "id": "lbl_01k2ja2000e0080000000000m1",
      "name": "bug",
      "color": "d73a4a",
      "description": "Something isn't working"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Remove All Pull Request Labels

DELETE

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/labels`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Removes every label from a pull request.

The request succeeds when the pull request has no labels. An unknown pull request returns `404`. The response body is empty.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/labels' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

### Remove Pull Request Label

DELETE

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/labels/{labelName}`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Removes one label from a pull request.

A label that is not assigned to the pull request returns `404`, as does an unknown pull request. The response lists the labels remaining on the pull request, ordered by name.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

`labelName` string Required

Name of the label to remove.

#### Response Fields

`labels` array

Labels remaining on the pull request, ordered by name. Each entry carries `id`, `name`, `color`, and `description`.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/labels/LABEL_NAME' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "id": "lbl_01k2ja2000e0080000000000m1",
      "name": "bug",
      "color": "d73a4a",
      "description": "Something isn't working"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Merge Pull Request

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/merge`

Requires scope `repository:contents:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Merges a pull request into its base.

For a stacked pull request, merges the entire root-to-target prefix ending at this pull number, not only this pull. Supported only on native Origin repositories; mirrored repositories are rejected.

The merge lands the head commit of the pull request's latest `version`. If the head branch has moved past that commit, for example because a push landed that Origin has not recorded as a new version yet, the request returns `Aborted` (HTTP 409 Conflict), the same answer as a stale `expectedHeadSha`, and nothing merges. Retry after [Get Pull Request](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-pull-request) reports the new head in `version.headSha`.

Merge Pull Request returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400), and nothing merges, when the pull request's base branch is the head branch of another open or draft pull request that it isn't stacked on, because the merge would land on that pull request's branch. For a stacked pull request, Origin checks the base of the stack's lowest unmerged pull request, where the merge lands. The repository's default branch never triggers this refusal, and neither does a base branch that an `active` `push_branch` ruleset with a `deletion` rule names in `includedRefNames`; a pattern that matches every branch, such as `~ALL`, doesn't count. Merge the other pull request first, or stack this one on it by setting `parentPullRequest` with [Update Pull Request](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#update-pull-request). [Get Pull Request Mergeability](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-pull-request-mergeability) reports the same condition as a `needs_restack` blocker.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

Pull number to merge. When this pull is stacked, the merge lands every pull from the stack root through this number.

#### Request Body

`expectedHeadSha` string

Guard against merging a head your app has not seen: the full commit SHA (40 or 64 hexadecimal characters) expected to be the pull request's current head. When the head has moved, the merge is rejected with `ABORTED` (HTTP 409 Conflict) and nothing merges. Values that are not a full commit SHA are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Omit to merge whatever the current head is. Not evaluated when the pull request is already merged, which returns idempotent success.

`mergeMethod` string

How the pull request lands. Allowed values: `merge`, which writes a merge commit, and `squash`, which writes a single squash commit. A method the repository does not allow is rejected with `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400), and any other value with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Omit it to use the repository's default: a merge commit when the repository allows one, otherwise a squash, and a squash when the base branch requires linear history.

#### Response Fields

`mergeCommitSha` string

SHA of the commit the merge wrote to the base branch. The pre-merge preview is a different commit, read through the `pull/<number>/merge` ref with [Get Git Ref](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-git-ref).

`mergedPullNumbers` array

JSON-string pull request numbers merged from stack root through the target.

`pullRequest` object

Target PullRequest after merge; the declared response type is the full resource even though the example is abbreviated.

`pullRequest.id` string

Stable Origin pull request identifier.

`pullRequest.number` string

Repository-local pull request number encoded as a JSON string.

`pullRequest.state` string

Pull request state; open or closed. Merged pull requests are closed with merged set true.

`pullRequest.draft` boolean

Whether the pull request is a draft.

`pullRequest.merged` boolean

Whether the pull request has merged.

`pullRequest.title` string

Pull request title.

`pullRequest.body` string

Tip commit SHA of this side at the change's latest version.

`pullRequest.base` object

The target side of the change — what it merges into.

`pullRequest.base.ref` string

The ref this side points at, as Origin records it.

`pullRequest.base.sha` string

Tip commit SHA of this side at the change's latest version.

`pullRequest.author` object

Public actor that opened the pull request.

`pullRequest.author.user` object

User variant of the actor. Set when a user performed the action.

`pullRequest.author.user.id` string

Public identifier for the user.

`pullRequest.author.user.email` string

Email address of the user. Always set when the user variant is present.

`pullRequest.author.user.displayName` string

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`pullRequest.author.user.handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle, without the `@` prefix. Present only while that profile is publicly visible; omitted otherwise.

`pullRequest.author.app` object

App variant of the actor. Set when an app performed the action.

`pullRequest.author.app.id` string

Public identifier for the app.

`pullRequest.author.app.displayName` string

The app's registered display name. Omitted when the app cannot be resolved and on Cursor's first-party managed actor.

`pullRequest.author.serviceAccount` object

Service account variant of the actor. Set when a service account performed the action.

`pullRequest.author.serviceAccount.id` string

Public identifier for the service account.

`pullRequest.author.serviceAccount.type` string

Product or feature the service account acts for. Allowed values: `bugbot`, `automations`, `agent_serve`, `agent`, `grok_bot`, `env_builds`. Absent when the account no longer exists or Cursor doesn't describe it. New values can be added; treat an absent or unrecognized value as an account of a product you don't recognize, never as an error.

`pullRequest.author.serviceAccount.displayName` string

Product name Cursor shows for the service account: `Cursor` for Cursor's own managed accounts, or a Grok bot's name. Never empty when present; a Grok bot whose name can't be read is named `Grok Bot`. Omitted when the account has no product name.

`pullRequest.createdAt` string

RFC 3339 pull request creation timestamp.

`pullRequest.updatedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for the latest pull request update.

`pullRequest.closedAt` string

RFC 3339 close timestamp; may appear on closed or merged pull requests.

`pullRequest.mergedAt` string

RFC 3339 merge timestamp; may appear on merged pull requests.

`pullRequest.mergeCommitSha` string

SHA of the commit the merge wrote to the base branch. Set once the pull request merges and absent before. The pre-merge preview is a different commit, read through the `pull/<number>/merge` ref with [Get Git Ref](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-git-ref).

`pullRequest.additions` integer

Added lines in the current pull request version.

`pullRequest.deletions` integer

Deleted lines in the current pull request version.

`pullRequest.labels[].color` string

Six-character hex color without a leading `#`.

`pullRequest.labels[].description` string

Label description. Absent when the label has none.

`pullRequest.stack` object

Stack membership: the chain of dependent pull requests this one belongs to, each stacked on the one it builds upon. Absent when the pull request is not part of a stack.

`pullRequest.stack.id` string

Stable stack identifier, shared by every member of the stack. Pass it as `stackId` to [List Pull Requests](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-pull-requests) to read the other members.

`pullRequest.stack.parentPullRequest` object

The pull request this one is stacked on. Absent on the root of the stack. A merged parent stays referenced until the child is retargeted or re-parented.

`pullRequest.stack.parentPullRequest.id` string

Stable Origin identifier of the parent pull request.

`pullRequest.stack.parentPullRequest.number` string

Repository-local number of the parent pull request, encoded as a JSON string.

`pullRequest.stack.parentPullRequest.repository` object

Repository the parent belongs to, carrying the same `id`, `name`, and `owner` fields as a check run's `repository`. Stacks never cross repositories, so this is always the pull request's own repository.

`pullRequest.webUrl` string

Output-only web URL for this pull request on Cursor. Absent when Origin can't form a link for it.

`pullRequest.version` object

Current numbered pull request version and its head/base SHAs.

`pullRequest.version.number` string

Monotonic pull request version number encoded as a JSON string.

`pullRequest.version.headSha` string

Head SHA captured by this pull request version.

`pullRequest.version.baseSha` string

Base SHA captured by this pull request version.

`pullRequest.version.createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for creation of this pull request version.

`pullRequest.version.potentialMergeCommit` object

Origin's test merge of this version, a commit that merges its `headSha` onto the base branch tip, and how far its preparation got. Present on every version. It describes this version only and stays readable after the pull request merges; it is a different commit from `mergeCommitSha`. For a stacked pull request the base branch is the parent's branch, so the test merge covers only this pull request's changes on top of it.

`pullRequest.version.potentialMergeCommit.state` string

How far the test merge's preparation got. Allowed values: `unknown`, `prepared`, `merge_conflict`. `unknown` means the test merge is not prepared: the version is waiting for its preparation, or the preparation timed out or failed. Every new version starts as `unknown`, so it never carries another version's commit. `prepared` means the test merge exists and `sha` and `baseSha` describe it. `merge_conflict` means merging `headSha` onto the base branch tip in `baseSha` conflicted, so there is no test merge; it is the condition [Get Pull Request Mergeability](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-pull-request-mergeability) reports as a `merge_conflict` blocker, and reopening the pull request prepares the version again. Treat an unrecognized value as `unknown`.

`pullRequest.version.potentialMergeCommit.sha` string

SHA of the two-parent test-merge commit: its first parent is this object's `baseSha` and its second parent is the version's `headSha`. Present only when `state` is `prepared`. The `pull/{pullNumber}/merge` ref points at it while this version is the latest. After that it stays readable by SHA through [Get Commit](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-commit), but it cannot be fetched by SHA over Git.

`pullRequest.version.potentialMergeCommit.baseSha` string

Base branch tip Origin merged `headSha` onto when it prepared this version: the test merge's first parent when `state` is `prepared`, and the tip the merge conflicted with when `state` is `merge_conflict`. Absent when `state` is `unknown`, and on a `merge_conflict` recorded before Origin reported this field for conflicts. It can be newer than `pullRequest.version.baseSha`, and Origin does not refresh it when the base branch merely advances.

### Prepare Pull Request Merge Ref

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/merge_ref`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Brings a pull request's test merge up to date with the current tip of its base branch.

The test merge is the merge commit at `refs/pull/{pullNumber}/merge`, which [Get Git Ref](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-git-ref) reads: its first parent is the base tip and its second parent is the head. Origin updates that ref when the pull request's head changes, but not when only the base branch moves, so a CI run that checks it out later can test an old base. Call this endpoint when the ref's first parent is behind the base tip.

When the recorded test merge already uses the current base tip, Origin returns it without recomputing. Otherwise it computes one merge against the current tip and returns the result, or `pending` when that merge can't finish within the request. Call again after `pending`: each call computes at most one merge, and concurrent calls for the same pull request share it.

Supported only on native Origin repositories. A mirrored repository, a closed or merged pull request, and a request made while Origin has the refresh turned off return `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

This operation is in preview and its shape can change while the contract settles. Decode responses with unknown fields and unknown enum values tolerated, and treat an unrecognized `state` as `pending`.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

Number of the pull request whose test merge to refresh.

#### Request Body

`expectedHeadSha` string

Guard against refreshing a head your app has not seen: the full commit SHA (40 or 64 hexadecimal characters) expected to be the pull request's current head. When the head differs, the request is rejected with `Aborted` (HTTP 409 Conflict) and nothing is computed. Values that are not a full commit SHA are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Omit it to refresh whatever the current head is.

#### Response Fields

`state` string

Result of the refresh. Allowed values: `mergeable`, meaning the test merge uses the current base tip and `mergeCommitSha` names it; `conflicted`, meaning the head doesn't merge cleanly into the current base tip; and `pending`, meaning the merge didn't finish within the request, so call again. Treat an unrecognized value as `pending`.

`mergeCommitSha` string

The test merge commit, whose first parent is `baseSha` and whose second parent is `headSha`. Set only when `state` is `mergeable`.

`baseSha` string

Tip of the base branch the merge was computed, or is being computed, against. Empty when `state` is `pending` and the base tip couldn't be read.

`headSha` string

Head commit of the pull request the merge is for.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/merge_ref' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "expectedHeadSha": "9a41f0c3d2b8e7f6a5c4d3e2f1b0a9c8d7e6f5a4"
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "state": "mergeable",
  "mergeCommitSha": "5c4d3e2f1a0b9c8d7e6f5a4b3c2d1e0f9a8b7c6d",
  "baseSha": "3b1f9c2d8a7e6f5049c8b7a6d5e4f3a2b1c0d9e8",
  "headSha": "9a41f0c3d2b8e7f6a5c4d3e2f1b0a9c8d7e6f5a4"
}
```

### Get Pull Request Mergeability

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/mergeability`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns whether the pull request can be merged and, when it cannot, the conditions that block it. The verdict is evaluated against the same conditions [Merge Pull Request](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#merge-pull-request) enforces, so a `mergeable` verdict means a merge of the same head is expected to succeed. For a stacked pull request the verdict covers every pull request from the stack root through this one, and each blocker names the pull request it belongs to.

A stack of more than 200 pull requests in total, merged ancestors included, returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

This operation is in preview and its shape can change while the contract settles. Decode responses with unknown fields and unknown enum values tolerated, treat an unrecognized `verdict` as `blocked`, and render `blockers[].message` when you do not recognize `blockers[].kind`.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

Repository-local pull request number.

#### Query Parameters

`expectedHeadSha` string

Optional guard: the full commit SHA, 40 or 64 hexadecimal characters, expected to be the pull request's current head. When it is set and the evaluated head differs, the request returns `Aborted` (HTTP 409 Conflict) instead of a result. A value that is not a full commit SHA returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Response Fields

`pullRequest` object

The pull request the verdict is about.

`pullRequest.id` string

Stable pull request identifier.

`pullRequest.number` string

Repository-local pull request number encoded as a JSON string.

`pullRequest.repository` object

Repository container reference for the pull request.

`pullRequest.repository.id` string

Repository identifier in a container reference.

`pullRequest.repository.name` string

Repository name in a container reference.

`pullRequest.repository.owner` object

Owner reference for the repository.

`pullRequest.repository.owner.slug` string

URL-facing owner slug used with the owner ID to identify the repository owner.

`pullRequest.repository.owner.id` string

Origin owner identifier.

`pullRequest.repository.owner.type` string

Owner namespace type. Output-only. Allowed values: `team`, `user`. Omitted when unknown.

`verdict` string

Overall answer for every pull request in `evaluatedPullRequests`. Allowed values: `mergeable`, meaning merging `pullRequest` lands all of them, and `blocked`. Treat an unrecognized value as `blocked`.

`blockers` array

Everything preventing the merge, ordered by the pull request they belong to, stack root first, and then by kind. Empty when `verdict` is `mergeable`. At most one blocker per pull request per kind, except `required_checks`, which carries one per state, and `rule_failure` and `ruleset_error`, which carry one per distinct message.

`blockers[].pullRequest` object

Pull request in `evaluatedPullRequests` this blocker belongs to. Carries the same fields as `pullRequest`.

`blockers[].kind` string

Category of the blocker. Allowed values: `draft`, `closed`, `merged`, `merge_conflict`, `required_checks`, `required_approvals`, `codeowner_approval`, `behind_base`, `needs_restack`, `restack_pending`, `conflict_check_pending`, `invalid_stack`, `ruleset_error`, `rule_failure`. Kinds are added over time; a blocker whose kind postdates your client decodes with `kind` unset and is still blocking.

`blockers[].message` string

Human-readable statement of the blocker and how to clear it. Never empty, so it is what to render when `kind` is unrecognized.

`blockers[].requiredChecks` object

Set on a `required_checks` blocker.

`blockers[].requiredChecks.state` string

State shared by every check in this blocker. Allowed values: `missing`, `pending`, `failing`, `action_required`.

`blockers[].requiredChecks.checks` array

Required checks in that state.

`blockers[].requiredChecks.checks[].name` string

Name the repository rule requires.

`blockers[].requiredChecks.checks[].owner` object

Principal expected to report the check, carrying the same actor variants as a check run's `actor`.

`blockers[].requiredChecks.checks[].checkRun` object

The check run on `headSha` matching this requirement, by reference. Omitted when none has been reported, which is state `missing`. It carries only `id`, `name`, and `checkSuite.id`, because this operation is readable with [`repository:pull_requests:read`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#scopes) alone while a run's status, conclusion, output, and details URL need [`repository:checks:read`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#scopes); read those with [Get Check Run](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#get-check-run).

`blockers[].requiredApprovals` object

Set on a `required_approvals` blocker.

`blockers[].requiredApprovals.requiredCount` integer

Approving reviews the repository rules require.

`blockers[].requiredApprovals.approvedCount` integer

Approving reviews currently counted toward the requirement.

`blockers[].codeownerApproval` object

Set on a `codeowner_approval` blocker.

`blockers[].codeownerApproval.requirements` array

Owner sets that still need an approval.

`blockers[].codeownerApproval.requirements[].owners` array

Code owners, any one of whom can satisfy the requirement.

`blockers[].codeownerApproval.requirements[].paths` array

Changed paths this owner set covers.

`blockers[].mergeConflict` object

Set on a `merge_conflict` blocker.

`blockers[].mergeConflict.conflictedPaths` array

Paths that conflict with the base branch. At most 100 are listed.

`blockers[].mergeConflict.truncated` boolean

Whether more paths conflict than are listed.

`blockers[].mergeConflict.inheritedFromDownstack` boolean

Whether the conflict comes from a pull request below this one in the stack. This pull request might also conflict on its own paths; `conflictsBeyondDownstack` says whether it does.

`blockers[].mergeConflict.conflictsBeyondDownstack` boolean

Whether this pull request conflicts on a path the pull request below it doesn't. `false` when every conflict is inherited from below, and `true` when this pull request isn't in a stack.

`blockers[].stackShape` object

Set on an `invalid_stack` blocker.

`blockers[].stackShape.reason` string

Why the stack cannot be evaluated. Allowed values: `partially_merged`, `cycle`, `missing_parent`, `cross_repository_parent`, `base_branch_missing`.

`blockers[].stackShape.relatedPullRequests` array

Other pull requests involved, when the reason names any. Each carries the same fields as `pullRequest`.

`evaluatedPullRequests` array

Pull requests a merge of `pullRequest` would land, stack root first and ending with `pullRequest`. Ancestors that already merged are history and are not listed. Exactly one element for an unstacked pull request. Each carries the same fields as `pullRequest`.

`headSha` string

Head commit of `pullRequest` that was evaluated.

`baseRef` string

Branch the evaluated pull requests merge into: the stack root's base, not this pull request's own base when it is stacked.

`baseSha` string

Tip commit of `baseRef` at `evaluatedAt`. A later push to `baseRef` can change the verdict. Empty when the base branch could not be determined, for example on an invalid stack.

`evaluatedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for when this result was evaluated. Changes after this time are not reflected; re-query to pick them up.

### List Pull Request Requested Reviewers

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/requested_reviewers`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists the users and groups whose review is currently requested on a pull request.

A direct request clears when that user submits a review, and a group request clears when any current member of the group submits. Unsubmitted draft reviews leave the request pending, and requesting review again after a submission returns the reviewer to this list. Groups without a readable public identifier are omitted.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

Repository-local pull request number.

#### Response Fields

Encoded user identifier (`user_…`), the same format the organization API uses.

`users[].email` string

Email address of the user. Empty when the account has none.

`users[].displayName` string

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`users[].handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle, without the `@` prefix. Present only while that profile is publicly visible; omitted otherwise.

`groups` array

Groups whose review is requested. Empty when none are pending.

### Request Pull Request Reviewers

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/requested_reviewers`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Requests reviews from the given users and groups on a pull request, and returns the reviewers this call requested.

Identifiers resolve against the repository's reviewer candidates by public id, user email, or group slug. Display names do not resolve. An unknown or ambiguous identifier returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) naming the identifier, and at least one non-empty entry is required across `users` and `groups`.

Requesting an already-requested reviewer bumps the request timestamp, so a reviewer who had submitted a review reappears as pending. A reviewer who is not a candidate for the repository returns `PermissionDenied` (HTTP 403).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

Repository-local pull request number.

#### Request Body

`users` array

User identifiers to request. Each entry must uniquely match a user candidate for the repository by public `user_…` id or email.

`groups` array

Group identifiers to request. Each entry must uniquely match a group candidate for the repository by public `grp_…` id, qualified group slug, or group slug.

#### Response Fields

`users` array

Users this call requested.

`users[].id` string

Encoded user identifier (`user_…`), the same format the organization API uses.

`users[].email` string

Email address of the user. Empty when the account has none.

`users[].displayName` string

Display name of the user: the account's first and last name joined with a space, the same name the product renders. Omitted when the account has no name.

`users[].handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle, without the `@` prefix. Present only while that profile is publicly visible; omitted otherwise.

`groups` array

Groups this call requested.

`groups[].id` string

Group public identifier (`grp_…`).

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/requested_reviewers' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "users": [
    "user_01k2ja2000e0080000000000c3"
  ],
  "groups": [
    "grp_01k2ja2000e0080000000000n2"
  ]
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "user_01k2ja2000e0080000000000c3",
      "email": "jane@acme.dev"
    }
  ],
  "groups": [

      "id": "grp_01k2ja2000e0080000000000n2"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Remove Pull Request Requested Reviewers

DELETE

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/requested_reviewers`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Removes requested reviews from the given users and groups on a pull request. The response body is empty.

Identifiers resolve against the repository's reviewer candidates by public id, user email, or group slug. Display names do not resolve. An unknown or ambiguous identifier returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) naming the identifier, and at least one non-empty entry is required across `users` and `groups`.

Removing a user or group that is not currently requested is a no-op. An identifier that is no longer a reviewer candidate is still accepted when it is a stable public id (`user_…` or `grp_…`), so a reviewer who left the repository can be cleared.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`pullNumber` string Required

Repository-local pull request number.

#### Request Body

`users` array

User identifiers to remove. Each entry must uniquely match a user candidate for the repository by public `user_…` id or email.

`groups` array

Group identifiers to remove. Each entry must uniquely match a group candidate for the repository by public `grp_…` id, qualified group slug, or group slug.

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/pulls/PULL_NUMBER/requested_reviewers' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "users": [
    "user_01k2ja2000e0080000000000c3"
  ],
  "groups": [
    "grp_01k2ja2000e0080000000000n2"
  ]
}'
```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

### Create Pull Request Review

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/reviews`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Creates and submits a review on a pull request, optionally together with its comments in one atomic request. Each comment takes the same targets [Create Pull Request Comment](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-pull-request-comment) takes: `comments[].inline` for a line range, `comments[].file` for a whole file, `comments[].threadId` for a reply, and none of them for general discussion.

The review is submitted immediately. A new `approve` or `request_changes` review supersedes the caller's prior live decision review on the same pull request, which is dismissed. Pull request authors cannot `approve` their own pull request. Fails with FAILED\_PRECONDITION while the caller has an unsubmitted draft review on the pull request.

When `comments` is set, every anchor is validated against the reviewed version's diff before anything is written, using the same in-diff check as [Create Pull Request Comment](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-pull-request-comment). If one comment fails, the whole request fails with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400) and nothing is published. Comments become visible atomically with the review: no comment or event is observable until the review submits, and then each comment emits its own [pull\_request.comment.created](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#events) webhook alongside the review's event.

The operation carries no idempotency key, so a retry after an ambiguous transport failure can create a second review. Call [List Pull Request Reviews](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-pull-request-reviews) before retrying.

### Dismiss Pull Request Review

PUT

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/pulls/{pullNumber}/reviews/{reviewId}/dismissals`

Requires scope `repository:pull_requests:reviews:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Dismisses a submitted review so its verdict no longer counts toward the pull request's review state. The review itself is retained and keeps appearing in ListPullRequestReviews, with `dismissal` set.

Dismissing does not require having authored the review; write permission on the repository's pull request reviews is sufficient, with two exceptions: a service account can dismiss only its own reviews, and dismissing another reviewer's `request_changes` review also requires write permission on the repository's contents, because a change request can block merge. Either exception returns `PermissionDenied` (HTTP 403).

Only `approve` and `request_changes` reviews can be dismissed, and only once: a `comment` review, an unsubmitted draft review, or an already-dismissed review returns FAILED\_PRECONDITION, and repeating the call leaves the first dismissal in place. A review that does not belong to the named pull request returns NOT\_FOUND.

### Create Ruleset

POST

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/rulesets`

Requires scope `repository:rulesets:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Creates a repository ruleset.

The response carries the stored ruleset, including the IDs Origin assigns to each rule and bypass actor. An empty `name` is rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

#### Request Body

`name` string Required

Ruleset name.

`description` string

Ruleset description.

`enforcement` string Required

How Origin enforces the ruleset. Allowed values: `active`, `evaluate`, `disabled`.

`kind` string Required

The operation the ruleset protects. Allowed values: `merge_branch`, `push_branch`, `push_tag`, `push_repository`.

`includedRefNames` array

Ref name patterns this ruleset includes. Supports globs and the tokens `~ALL` and `~DEFAULT_BRANCH`. Values above 64 entries are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`excludedRefNames` array

Ref name patterns this ruleset excludes. Same pattern language and 64-entry cap as `includedRefNames`.

`rules` array

Protection rules to store. Each entry carries `ruleType` and optional `parameters`; Origin assigns each rule's `id`. Values above 20 entries are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Each rule type runs in one kind of ruleset: a `merge_branch` ruleset accepts only the merge rule types `pull_request`, `require_status_checks`, and `require_branch_up_to_date`, and a `push_branch`, `push_tag`, or `push_repository` ruleset accepts only the push rule types `deletion`, `non_fast_forward`, `block_direct_updates`, `block_merges`, `ref_name_pattern`, and `required_linear_history`. A rule whose type never runs in the ruleset's `kind` returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`rules[].ruleType` string Required

Rule type. A `merge_branch` ruleset accepts `pull_request`, `require_status_checks`, and `require_branch_up_to_date`. A `push_branch`, `push_tag`, or `push_repository` ruleset accepts `deletion`, `non_fast_forward`, `block_direct_updates`, `block_merges`, `ref_name_pattern`, and `required_linear_history`. Any other value, or a type the ruleset's `kind` doesn't accept, is rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`rules[].parameters` object

Type-specific parameters as a JSON object. The shape depends on `rules[].ruleType`, and unknown keys are rejected. `require_branch_up_to_date`, `deletion`, `non_fast_forward`, `block_merges`, and `required_linear_history` take no parameters: send `{}` or omit `parameters`. `pull_request` parameters are also accepted in snake\_case, such as `required_approving_review_count`; the camelCase key wins when both are sent.

`rules[].parameters.requiredApprovingReviewCount` integer

For `pull_request` rules: how many approving reviews the pull request needs, from 0 to 50. Defaults to 1.

`rules[].parameters.requireCodeOwnerReview` boolean

For `pull_request` rules: when `true`, every changed path that has code owners must also be approved by one of its owners. Defaults to `false`.

`rules[].parameters.dismissStaleReviewsOnPush` boolean

For `pull_request` rules: not supported yet. `true` makes the rule fail for every pull request it applies to. Defaults to `false`.

`rules[].parameters.requireLastPushApproval` boolean

For `pull_request` rules: not supported yet. `true` makes the rule fail for every pull request it applies to. Defaults to `false`.

`rules[].parameters.requiredReviewThreadResolution` boolean

For `pull_request` rules: not supported yet. `true` makes the rule fail for every pull request it applies to. Defaults to `false`.

`rules[].parameters.requiredChecks` array

For `require_status_checks` rules, where it's required: checks that must all pass on the pull request's head commit before it can merge. An empty list requires nothing. Entries that repeat the same `actorKind`, `actorId`, `groupKey`, and `runKey` are rejected. A check is named by the actor that reports it and the keys it reports under, never by a display name or context string, and every value must be a non-empty string.

`rules[].parameters.requiredChecks[].actorKind` string

Kind of the check suite's `actor`: `app`, `service_account`, or `user`. Required in each entry.

`rules[].parameters.requiredChecks[].actorId` string

The actor's ID exactly as the check suite's `actor` reports it, such as `app_…`, `sa_…`, or `user_…`. A bare UUID or an ID containing `|` is rejected. An ID that names no actor is accepted but never matches, so the check reads as missing. Required in each entry.

`rules[].parameters.requiredChecks[].groupKey` string

The check suite `key` the actor reports. Required in each entry.

`rules[].parameters.requiredChecks[].runKey` string

A check run `key` in that suite. When set, only the newest run with this key must pass; when omitted, every run in the suite must pass. A run passes when it completes as `success`, `neutral`, or `skipped`.

`rules[].parameters.requiredChecks[].name` string

Label merge blockers show for this check in place of `actorKind/actorId/groupKey[/runKey]`. Matching ignores it.

`rules[].parameters.blockDirectUpdates` boolean

For `block_direct_updates` rules: when `true`, a targeted ref can be created or updated only by merging a pull request. When `false`, the rule has no effect. Defaults to `true`.

`rules[].parameters.pattern` string

For `ref_name_pattern` rules, where it's required: an RE2 regular expression, 1 to 1024 characters. A created or updated branch or tag name, without `refs/heads/` or `refs/tags/`, must match it. A match anywhere in the name counts; anchor the pattern with `^` and `$` to match the whole name.

`rules[].parameters.negate` boolean

For `ref_name_pattern` rules: when `true`, the name must not match `pattern`. Defaults to `false`.

`bypassActors` array

Bypass principals to store. Each entry carries `bypassMode` and exactly one of `user`, `team`, `app`, or `originRole`; Origin assigns each actor's `id`. Identify a `user` by its public ID (`user_…`) in `user.id`. Values above 15 entries are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

Protection rules in this ruleset.

`rules[].id` string

Stable Origin ID for this rule.

A `push_branch`, `push_tag`, or `push_repository` ruleset accepts `deletion`, `non_fast_forward`, `block_direct_updates`, `block_merges`, `ref_name_pattern`, and `required_linear_history`.

`rules[].parameters` object

Type-specific parameters as a JSON object. The shape depends on `rules[].ruleType`; [Create Ruleset](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-ruleset) lists the parameters of each rule type.

`bypassActors` array

Principals that can bypass this ruleset. A bypass actor whose stored identity cannot be read is omitted from the response.

`bypassActors[].id` string

Stable Origin ID for this bypass actor.

`bypassActors[].bypassMode` string

When the bypass applies. Allowed values: `always`, `pull_request_only`.

`bypassActors[].user` object

A user principal. Exactly one of `user`, `team`, `app`, or `originRole` is present.

`bypassActors[].user.id` string

The user's public ID (`user_…`).

`bypassActors[].team` object

### Get Ruleset

GET

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/rulesets/{rulesetId}`

Requires scope `repository:rulesets:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Returns a single repository ruleset by its stable Origin ID.

An unknown repository and an unknown ruleset both return `404`; the message distinguishes them.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

### Update Ruleset

PUT

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/rulesets/{rulesetId}`

Requires scope `repository:rulesets:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Updates an existing repository ruleset.

The request replaces the whole ruleset configuration. `rules` and `bypassActors` are replaced in full rather than merged, and Origin assigns new IDs to the stored entries, so send every rule and bypass actor you want to keep.

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`rulesetId` string Required

Stable Origin ruleset ID.

#### Request Body

`name` string Required

Ruleset name.

`description` string

Ruleset description.

`enforcement` string Required

How Origin enforces the ruleset. Allowed values: `active`, `evaluate`, `disabled`.

`kind` string Required

The operation the ruleset protects. Allowed values: `merge_branch`, `push_branch`, `push_tag`, `push_repository`.

`includedRefNames` array

Ref name patterns this ruleset includes. Supports globs and the tokens `~ALL` and `~DEFAULT_BRANCH`. Values above 64 entries are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`excludedRefNames` array

Ref name patterns this ruleset excludes. Same pattern language and 64-entry cap as `includedRefNames`.

`rules` array

Protection rules to store. Each entry carries `ruleType` and optional `parameters`; Origin assigns each rule's `id`. Values above 20 entries are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). Each rule type runs in one kind of ruleset: a `merge_branch` ruleset accepts only the merge rule types `pull_request`, `require_status_checks`, and `require_branch_up_to_date`, and a `push_branch`, `push_tag`, or `push_repository` ruleset accepts only the push rule types `deletion`, `non_fast_forward`, `block_direct_updates`, `block_merges`, `ref_name_pattern`, and `required_linear_history`. A rule whose type never runs in the ruleset's `kind` returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`rules[].ruleType` string Required

Rule type. A `merge_branch` ruleset accepts `pull_request`, `require_status_checks`, and `require_branch_up_to_date`. A `push_branch`, `push_tag`, or `push_repository` ruleset accepts `deletion`, `non_fast_forward`, `block_direct_updates`, `block_merges`, `ref_name_pattern`, and `required_linear_history`. Any other value, or a type the ruleset's `kind` doesn't accept, is rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

`rules[].parameters` object

Type-specific parameters as a JSON object. The shape depends on `rules[].ruleType`, and unknown keys are rejected. `require_branch_up_to_date`, `deletion`, `non_fast_forward`, `block_merges`, and `required_linear_history` take no parameters: send `{}` or omit `parameters`. `pull_request` parameters are also accepted in snake\_case, such as `required_approving_review_count`; the camelCase key wins when both are sent.

`rules[].parameters.requiredApprovingReviewCount` integer

For `pull_request` rules: how many approving reviews the pull request needs, from 0 to 50. Defaults to 1.

`rules[].parameters.requireCodeOwnerReview` boolean

For `pull_request` rules: when `true`, every changed path that has code owners must also be approved by one of its owners. Defaults to `false`.

`rules[].parameters.dismissStaleReviewsOnPush` boolean

For `pull_request` rules: not supported yet. `true` makes the rule fail for every pull request it applies to. Defaults to `false`.

`rules[].parameters.requireLastPushApproval` boolean

For `pull_request` rules: not supported yet. `true` makes the rule fail for every pull request it applies to. Defaults to `false`.

`rules[].parameters.requiredReviewThreadResolution` boolean

For `pull_request` rules: not supported yet. `true` makes the rule fail for every pull request it applies to. Defaults to `false`.

`rules[].parameters.requiredChecks` array

For `require_status_checks` rules, where it's required: checks that must all pass on the pull request's head commit before it can merge. An empty list requires nothing. Entries that repeat the same `actorKind`, `actorId`, `groupKey`, and `runKey` are rejected. A check is named by the actor that reports it and the keys it reports under, never by a display name or context string, and every value must be a non-empty string.

`rules[].parameters.requiredChecks[].actorKind` string

Kind of the check suite's `actor`: `app`, `service_account`, or `user`. Required in each entry.

`rules[].parameters.requiredChecks[].actorId` string

The actor's ID exactly as the check suite's `actor` reports it, such as `app_…`, `sa_…`, or `user_…`. A bare UUID or an ID containing `|` is rejected. An ID that names no actor is accepted but never matches, so the check reads as missing. Required in each entry.

`rules[].parameters.requiredChecks[].groupKey` string

The check suite `key` the actor reports. Required in each entry.

`rules[].parameters.requiredChecks[].runKey` string

A check run `key` in that suite. When set, only the newest run with this key must pass; when omitted, every run in the suite must pass. A run passes when it completes as `success`, `neutral`, or `skipped`.

`rules[].parameters.requiredChecks[].name` string

Label merge blockers show for this check in place of `actorKind/actorId/groupKey[/runKey]`. Matching ignores it.

`rules[].parameters.blockDirectUpdates` boolean

For `block_direct_updates` rules: when `true`, a targeted ref can be created or updated only by merging a pull request. When `false`, the rule has no effect. Defaults to `true`.

`rules[].parameters.pattern` string

For `ref_name_pattern` rules, where it's required: an RE2 regular expression, 1 to 1024 characters. A created or updated branch or tag name, without `refs/heads/` or `refs/tags/`, must match it. A match anywhere in the name counts; anchor the pattern with `^` and `$` to match the whole name.

`rules[].parameters.negate` boolean

For `ref_name_pattern` rules: when `true`, the name must not match `pattern`. Defaults to `false`.

`bypassActors` array

Bypass principals to store. Each entry carries `bypassMode` and exactly one of `user`, `team`, `app`, or `originRole`; Origin assigns each actor's `id`. Identify a `user` by its public ID (`user_…`) in `user.id`. Values above 15 entries are rejected with `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Stable Origin ruleset ID.

`name` string

Ruleset name.

`description` string

Ruleset description.

`enforcement` string

How Origin enforces the ruleset. Allowed values: `active`, `evaluate`, `disabled`.

`kind` string

`includedRefNames` array

Ref name patterns this ruleset includes. Supports globs and the tokens `~ALL` and `~DEFAULT_BRANCH`.

`excludedRefNames` array

Ref name patterns this ruleset excludes. Same pattern language as `includedRefNames`.

`rules` array

Protection rules in this ruleset.

`rules[].id` string

Stable Origin ID for this rule.

`rules[].ruleType` string

Rule type. A `merge_branch` ruleset accepts `pull_request`, `require_status_checks`, and `require_branch_up_to_date`. A `push_branch`, `push_tag`, or `push_repository` ruleset accepts `deletion`, `non_fast_forward`, `block_direct_updates`, `block_merges`, `ref_name_pattern`, and `required_linear_history`.

`rules[].parameters` object

Type-specific parameters as a JSON object. The shape depends on `rules[].ruleType`; [Create Ruleset](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-ruleset) lists the parameters of each rule type.

`bypassActors` array

Principals that can bypass this ruleset. A bypass actor whose stored identity cannot be read is omitted from the response.

`bypassActors[].id` string

Stable Origin ID for this bypass actor.

`bypassActors[].bypassMode` string

When the bypass applies. Allowed values: `always`, `pull_request_only`.

`bypassActors[].user` object

A user principal. Exactly one of `user`, `team`, `app`, or `originRole` is present.

`bypassActors[].user.id` string

The user's public ID (`user_…`).

`bypassActors[].team` object

A team principal.

`bypassActors[].team.organizationPublicId` string

Immutable organization public ID.

`bypassActors[].team.groupPublicId` string

### Delete Ruleset

DELETE

`/v1/origin/repos/{ownerSlug}/{repoName}/rulesets/{rulesetId}`

Requires scope `repository:rulesets:write` (installation access token or user access token).

Deletes a repository ruleset by its stable Origin ID. The response body is empty.

An unknown repository and an unknown ruleset both return `404`; the message distinguishes them. A ruleset stored on a different repository reads as an unknown ruleset. An empty `rulesetId` returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400).

#### Path Parameters

`ownerSlug` string Required

Owning entity's unique slug.

`repoName` string Required

Repo name, unique to the owner entity.

`rulesetId` string Required

Stable Origin ruleset ID.

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/repos/OWNER_SLUG/REPO_NAME/rulesets/RULESET_ID' \

## SSH certificate authorities

An SSH certificate authority is a public key an owner trusts: user certificates it signs authenticate git over SSH on the owner's repositories, so members of the owning team can use git over SSH without registering an SSH key. These endpoints list the authorities an owner trusts, add and remove them, and set whether the owner requires certificates. Authorities belong to team-owned owners, and the duplicate check on add is scoped to the owner rather than to Origin as a whole, so more than one owner can trust the same authority.

Listing accepts installation and user tokens. Adding and removing authorities and setting the requirement take a Cursor user credential holding `namespace:settings:write`; app and installation tokens are not accepted.

### List SSH Certificate Authorities

GET

`/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/ssh-certificate-authorities`

Requires scope `namespace:settings:read` (installation access token or user access token).

Lists the SSH certificate authorities an owner trusts for git over SSH, newest first, together with whether the owner requires certificates. The response is not paginated: every authority is returned.

#### Path Parameters

`namespaceSlug` string Required

Slug of the namespace whose authorities to list.

#### Response Fields

`certificateAuthorities` array

Every authority the owner trusts, newest first.

`certificateAuthorities[].id` string

Identifier of the authority; [Delete SSH Certificate Authority](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#delete-ssh-certificate-authority) takes it as `certificateAuthorityId`.

`certificateAuthorities[].name` string

Label given when the authority was added.

`certificateAuthorities[].keyType` string

OpenSSH key type of the authority's public key, for example `ssh-ed25519`.

`certificateAuthorities[].fingerprint` string

SHA-256 fingerprint of the public key as `SHA256:<base64>`, the form `ssh-keygen -l` prints.

`certificateAuthorities[].publicKey` string

The authority's public key as `<key_type> <base64>`, without a comment.

`certificateAuthorities[].createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for when the authority was added.

`requireCertificates` boolean

Whether the owner requires SSH certificates; see [Set SSH Certificate Requirement](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#set-ssh-certificate-requirement).

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/namespaces/NAMESPACE_SLUG/ssh-certificate-authorities' \

      "createdAt": "2026-08-02T14:45:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "requireCertificates": true
}
```

### Add SSH Certificate Authority

POST

`/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/ssh-certificate-authorities`

Requires scope `namespace:settings:write` (user access token).

Adds an SSH certificate authority the owner trusts and returns it. Members of the owning team can then use git over SSH on the owner's repositories with user certificates the authority signed, without registering an SSH key.

`publicKey` is the authority's own public key as one OpenSSH `authorized_keys` line. A certificate, an unsupported key type, or an RSA key under 2048 bits returns `InvalidArgument` (HTTP 400). A key the owner already lists returns `AlreadyExists` (HTTP 409 Conflict); the check is scoped to the owner, so more than one owner can trust the same authority. Authorities can be added to team-owned owners only; any other owner returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400).

The caller must be a Cursor user credential holding `namespace:settings:write`. App and installation tokens are not accepted.

#### Path Parameters

`namespaceSlug` string Required

Namespace slug.

#### Request Body

`publicKey` string Required

The authority's public key as one OpenSSH `authorized_keys` line (`<key_type> <base64> [comment]`). Accepted key types are `ssh-ed25519`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp384`, `ecdsa-sha2-nistp521`, and `ssh-rsa` with a modulus of at least 2048 bits. Certificates are not accepted.

`name` string Required

Label for the authority, at most 255 characters.

#### Response Fields

`id` string

Identifier of the authority; [Delete SSH Certificate Authority](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#delete-ssh-certificate-authority) takes it as `certificateAuthorityId`.

`name` string

Label given when the authority was added.

`keyType` string

OpenSSH key type of the authority's public key, for example `ssh-ed25519`.

`fingerprint` string

SHA-256 fingerprint of the public key as `SHA256:<base64>`, the form `ssh-keygen -l` prints.

`publicKey` string

The authority's public key as `<key_type> <base64>`, without a comment.

`createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp for when the authority was added.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/namespaces/NAMESPACE_SLUG/ssh-certificate-authorities' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \

}
```

### Delete SSH Certificate Authority

DELETE

`/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/ssh-certificate-authorities/{certificateAuthorityId}`

Requires scope `namespace:settings:write` (user access token).

Removes an SSH certificate authority from the owner. Every certificate the authority signed stops working. While the owner requires certificates, its last authority cannot be removed; the request returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400). The response body is empty.

The caller must be a Cursor user credential holding `namespace:settings:write`. App and installation tokens are not accepted.

#### Path Parameters

`namespaceSlug` string Required

Namespace slug.

`certificateAuthorityId` string Required

`id` of the authority to remove.

#### Response Fields

Successful requests return no response body.

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/namespaces/NAMESPACE_SLUG/ssh-certificate-authorities/CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITY_ID' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN'
```

**Response:**

```text
204 No Content
```

### Set SSH Certificate Requirement

POST

`/v1/origin/namespaces/{namespaceSlug}/ssh-certificate-authorities:setRequirement`

Requires scope `namespace:settings:write` (user access token).

Sets whether the owner requires SSH certificates and returns the owner's setting. While required, git over SSH on the owner's repositories accepts only certificates from the owner's authorities: SSH keys registered by users are refused, and so are user API keys over HTTPS. Requiring certificates needs at least one listed authority; otherwise the request returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400). Setting the current value succeeds without change.

The caller must be a Cursor user credential holding `namespace:settings:write`. App and installation tokens are not accepted.

#### Path Parameters

`namespaceSlug` string Required

Namespace slug.

#### Request Body

`requireCertificates` boolean Required

True to require SSH certificates on the owner's repositories, false to stop requiring them.

#### Response Fields

`requireCertificates` boolean

Whether the owner requires SSH certificates for git over SSH.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.cursor.com/v1/origin/namespaces/NAMESPACE_SLUG/ssh-certificate-authorities:setRequirement' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ORIGIN_TOKEN' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "requireCertificates": true
}'
```

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "requireCertificates": true
}
```

## Webhooks

Origin sends signed HTTP `POST` requests to the app's registered HTTPS webhook URL with `content-type: application/json`.

Delivery is at least once. Deduplicate retries with `webhook-id`, durably accept the request, return `2xx` quickly, and process the event asynchronously.

Origin waits 10 seconds for the receiver's response headers. That deadline covers DNS resolution, the connection, the TLS handshake, and the time to the response, and it applies to every attempt. An attempt that passes it is recorded as a transport error and retried on the [Retries](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#retries) schedule. Repeated failures can [disable delivery automatically](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#automatic-disable).

To confirm a receiver works before any real event reaches it, call [Ping Webhook](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#ping-webhook).

Origin delivers events for mirrored repositories, and installation event payloads list them in the selected repository arrays. Delivery does not widen what the installation can call: see [Mirrored repositories](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#mirrored-repositories).

### Headers

| Header                    | Description                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content-type`            | `application/json`                                        |
| `user-agent`              | `Cursor-Origin-Webhook/1.0`                               |
| `webhook-id`              | Stable delivery ID and idempotency key.                   |
| `webhook-timestamp`       | Unix timestamp included in the signature.                 |
| `webhook-signature`       | `v1ed,BASE64_SIGNATURE`                                   |
| `webhook-event-type`      | Event slug for routing.                                   |
| `webhook-event-id`        | Underlying Origin event ID mirrored from the signed body. |
| `webhook-app-id`          | Target app ID.                                            |
| `webhook-installation-id` | Target installation ID.                                   |

Routing headers are conveniences. After signature verification, the body is authoritative.

### Signature verification

Use the raw request body before parsing it. Construct:

```text
lowercaseHex(SHA-256("<webhook-id>.<webhook-timestamp>.<raw-request-body>"))
```

Verify the Ed25519 signature over the UTF-8 bytes of that hexadecimal digest against an active Origin JWKS key. Reject timestamps more than five minutes from the current time.

Standard Webhooks libraries do not verify Origin deliveries. The headers use Standard Webhooks names, but Origin signs the SHA-256 digest instead of the signed content itself, under a `v1ed` version tag the Standard Webhooks spec doesn't define. Verify with the construction above, as the following example does.

```typescript
import {
  createHash,
  createPublicKey,
  verify,
  type JsonWebKeyInput,
} from "node:crypto";

export async function verifyOriginWebhook(
  body: Buffer,
  headers: Record<string, string | undefined>

### Delivery envelope

Each request wraps the event payload with delivery, app, and installation identity:

```json
{
  "deliveryId": "whd_01...",
  "appId": "app_01...",
  "installationId": "i_01...",
  "event": {
    "id": "evt_01...",
    "type": "pull_request.comment.created",
    "eventTime": "2026-07-01T10:03:00Z",
    "payload": {}
  }
}
```

`deliveryId` is stable across retries. `event.id` identifies the underlying domain event.

### Retries

Origin retries transport errors, `429`, and `5xx` responses up to seven total attempts. Other `4xx` responses are terminal.

The first attempt is the original send. The six retries wait 5 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 4 minutes, and 8 minutes, in that order.

A receiver that fails every attempt sees seven `POST`s over about 16 minutes. `webhook-id` stays the same on every attempt. Deduplicate on it.

### Automatic disable

An owner can pause an app's webhook delivery from the app's settings. Origin also disables it on its own when the receiver fails at least 20 delivery rounds across a 72-hour window, with no successful delivery in that window, and the failures reach more than one installer namespace.

Delivery stops until an owner resumes it. [Batch Redeliver Webhook Deliveries](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#batch-redeliver-webhook-deliveries) returns `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400) and queues nothing. The API exposes no field for the paused state, so treat that `FailedPrecondition` as the signal.

Clearing the app's `webhookUrl` through [Update App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#update-app) is a separate action. It cancels the pending deliveries, and setting a URL again does not bring them back.

### Recovery

Use an app JWT to query [`GET /app/webhook/deliveries`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-webhook-deliveries). Filter by delivery status, event type, installation, time range, or page token. `delivered=false` returns every delivery the receiver has never acknowledged with `2xx`. Deliveries stay listable for seven days, so recover within that window.

Use [`POST /app/webhook/deliveries:batchRedeliver`](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#batch-redeliver-webhook-deliveries) to queue redelivery for up to 100 delivery IDs. The operation deduplicates IDs and reports the result for each delivery. A paused or [automatically disabled](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#automatic-disable) app rejects the call with `FailedPrecondition` (HTTP 400) and queues nothing.

| `repository.check_run.annotations.created` | Annotations are added to a check run with [Create Check Run Annotations](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-check-run-annotations). Each request delivers one event. |
| `installation.created`                     | The app is installed.                                                                                                                                                                     |

Every event's payload shape is documented field by field in [Event payloads](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#event-payloads).

The five `installation.*` events go to the app itself rather than to a repository subscription. Origin always sends them, so they do not appear in the app's selectable event list. Every other event in this table is a repository-scoped subscription.

A new app subscribes to none of the repository-scoped events. Select the ones you need in the app's settings, or set them with the `events` field of [Create App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#create-app) or [Update App](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#update-app). Origin delivers an event only to apps subscribed to it, with a webhook URL set, whose installation covers the repository and holds the scope the event requires. Otherwise there's no delivery and no error: nothing is sent, and nothing appears in [List Webhook Deliveries](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#list-webhook-deliveries).

Origin does not deliver `repository.pushed` for a repository it mirrors from GitHub. GitHub owns those pushes and sends its own push webhooks, so an Origin delivery would duplicate them. Pushes to native Origin repositories are delivered as usual, and the mirror state does not affect any other event. `repository.deleted` is delivered for a repository mirrored from GitHub: stopping the sync deletes the Cursor-side repository only, and GitHub sends nothing for it.

### Event payloads

Each event's [envelope](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/llms-full.txt#delivery-envelope) carries the event's payload object in `payload`. Events that share a shape share a payload family; each family below documents the events that deliver it, its fields, and a sample payload, generated from the [OpenAPI specification](https://cursor.com/docs/api/origin/openapi.yaml). In the spec, each payload schema's `x-origin-webhook-events` extension lists the events that deliver it.

### Repository Created

EVENT

`repository.created`

`repository.name` string

`repository.owner` object

The owner of a repo.

`repository.owner.slug` string

Unique URL-friendly name of the owner.

`refUpdates[].ref` string

The full git ref that was pushed. Example: `refs/heads/main` or `refs/tags/v3.14.1`.

`refUpdates[].before` string

The SHA of the most recent commit on `ref` before the push. All-zero (`0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`) when the ref was just created.

`refUpdates[].after` string

The SHA of the most recent commit on `ref` after the push. All-zero (`0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`) when the ref was deleted.

`refUpdates[].created` boolean

Whether this push created the ref.

`refUpdates[].deleted` boolean

Whether this push deleted the ref.

`refUpdates[].forced` boolean

Whether this push rewrote history: a non-fast-forward update of an existing ref (the new tip is not a descendant of the old tip). False for ref creates, deletes, fast-forward updates, and pushes observed before Origin tracked force-push status.

`refUpdates[].headCommit` object

`pushedAt` string

When Origin observed the push. RFC 3339 timestamp.

`pusher` object

The principal that performed the push, as verified by Origin. Absent when Origin itself performed the push, such as the merge push that advances the base ref when a pull request merges, and when Origin could not resolve the pusher when the event was recorded, such as a user whose account no longer exists.

`pusher.user.performedVia.serviceAccount.id` string

`pusher.user.performedVia.serviceAccount.type` string

Which product or feature the account acts for. Unset when the account no longer exists. The set is append-only: an unrecognized value decodes as unset under `ignoreUnknownFields` / `DiscardUnknown`; treat an unset type as an account of a product you do not recognize, never as an error.

`checkRun.externalId` string

Provider-assigned immutable identity for this check attempt (see `CheckRunInput.external_id`: one per execution is the recommended style).

`checkRun.actor.user.id` string

`checkRun.actor.user.email` string Required

### Check Run Rerequested

EVENT

`repository.check_run.rerequested`

repository.check\_run.rerequested webhook payload, delivered only to the app that owns the check run. Answer by posting a fresh run for the same head SHA and key — a new run (new external\_id) or an update of the re-requested run. The stamped run reads `status: rerequested` (its conclusion and timings are the superseded result) until the answering post clears `rerequested_at`. Each accepted re-request emits one event, and a run may be re-requested again once answered, so dedupe redeliveries on the event id alone; `check_run.rerequested_at` carries the outstanding stamp. The payload carries no pull request context (check runs attach to `(repository, sha)`): a consumer that needs the pull request resolves it from `check_run.sha` via its own head mapping, or `ListPullRequests` filtered to the head branch it built.

#### Payload Fields

`repository` object

The repository the check run belongs to.

`repository.id` string

`repository.name` string

`repository.owner` object

The owner of a repo.

`repository.owner.slug` string

Unique URL-friendly name of the owner.

`repository.owner.id` string

Unique ID of the owner namespace.

`repository.owner.type` string

`team` or `user`. Output-only; unset when unknown. One of `team`, `user`.

`checkSuite` object

The suite the check run belongs to.

`checkSuite.id` string

Server-assigned unique ID of the suite.

`checkSuite.repository` object

Repository the suite belongs to.

`checkSuite.repository.id` string

`checkSuite.repository.name` string

`checkSuite.repository.owner` object

The owner of a repo.

`checkSuite.repository.owner.slug` string

Unique URL-friendly name of the owner.

`checkSuite.repository.owner.id` string

Unique ID of the owner namespace.

`checkSuite.repository.owner.type` string

`team` or `user`. Output-only; unset when unknown. One of `team`, `user`.

`checkSuite.sha` string

Resolved head commit SHA the suite is attached to (lowercase hex).

`checkSuite.baseSha` string

The comparison base this attempt was reported against (lowercase hex), when the reporting app supplied one: a pull request version's `base_sha`. Part of the attempt's identity, so one app can report one attempt per (head, base) pair. Absent means the attempt is base-agnostic and applies to every pull request at `sha`. A pull request's CI state and required checks consider only base-agnostic attempts and the ones reported against that pull request's latest version `base_sha`; commit-scoped listings (`ListCheckSuitesForCommit`, `ListCheckRunsForCommit`) return every base.

`checkSuite.key` string

App-chosen idempotency key for the suite.

`checkSuite.name` string

Human-facing suite name.

`checkSuite.detailsUrl` string

Link to more detail about the suite as a whole, if set.

`checkSuite.createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp.

`checkSuite.updatedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp.

`checkSuite.externalId` string

Provider-assigned immutable identity for this suite attempt.

`checkSuite.actor` object

Principal that produced the suite.

`checkSuite.actor.user` object

`checkSuite.actor.user.id` string

`checkSuite.actor.user.email` string Required

`checkSuite.actor.user.displayName` string

Human-readable display name: the account's first and last name, each trimmed, joined with a space — exactly the name the product UI renders. Omitted when the account has no name; never synthesized from the email, the id, or any other field. May also be absent on webhook payloads whose actor could not be resolved.

`checkSuite.actor.user.handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle (the identity behind cursor.com /@handle), without the @ prefix. Present only while the user's profile is publicly visible; omitted for users without a claimed handle and for non-public profiles.

`checkSuite.actor.user.performedVia` object

Set when an app (with an installation user token) or a service account, such as the user's personal Grok bot, acted on this user's behalf, for the action this field describes: on a comment's author it names what created the comment, not an actor that later edited or deleted it. Absent when the user acted directly; may be absent when delegation data is unavailable.

`checkSuite.actor.user.performedVia.app` object

The app that acted on the user's behalf.

`checkSuite.actor.user.performedVia.app.id` string

`checkSuite.actor.user.performedVia.app.displayName` string

`checkSuite.actor.user.performedVia.serviceAccount.id` string

`checkSuite.actor.user.performedVia.serviceAccount.type` string

Which product or feature the account acts for. Unset when the account no longer exists. The set is append-only: an unrecognized value decodes as unset under `ignoreUnknownFields` / `DiscardUnknown`; treat an unset type as an account of a product you do not recognize, never as an error. One of `bugbot`, `automations`, `agent_serve`, `agent`, `grok_bot`, `env_builds`.

`checkSuite.actor.user.performedVia.serviceAccount.displayName` string

The product name Cursor shows for the account, such as a Grok bot's name; never empty when present. A Grok bot whose name cannot be read is named "Grok Bot". Omitted when the account has no product name.

`checkSuite.actor.app` object

`checkSuite.actor.app.id` string

`checkSuite.actor.app.displayName` string

The app's registered display name, never empty when present. Omitted on payloads whose app could not be resolved and on the first-party Cursor facade actor.

`checkSuite.actor.serviceAccount` object

`checkSuite.actor.serviceAccount.id` string

`checkSuite.actor.serviceAccount.type` string

Which product or feature the account acts for. Unset when the account no longer exists. The set is append-only: an unrecognized value decodes as unset under `ignoreUnknownFields` / `DiscardUnknown`; treat an unset type as an account of a product you do not recognize, never as an error.

Unique URL-friendly name of the owner.

`checkRun.repository.owner.id` string

Unique ID of the owner namespace.

`checkRun.repository.owner.type` string

`team` or `user`. Output-only; unset when unknown. One of `team`, `user`.

`checkRun.checkSuite` object

Suite this check run belongs to.

`checkRun.checkSuite.id` string

`checkRun.sha` string

Resolved head commit SHA the check run is attached to (lowercase hex).

`checkRun.baseSha` string

The comparison base this run was reported against (lowercase hex), when the reporting app supplied one; always the owning suite's `base_sha`. Absent means base-agnostic (see `CheckSuite.base_sha`).

`checkRun.key` string

App-chosen idempotency key for the check run.

`checkRun.name` string

Human-facing check-run name.

`checkRun.status` string

Lifecycle state. `failing` is a run still going whose app already knows it will not pass: pending for gates and required checks, no `conclusion` yet, an early warning for readers. `rerequested` is a completed run whose re-run was requested and not yet answered by the owning app: pending for readers (render like `queued`), with `conclusion` and the timings still describing the superseded attempt. Set only by Origin on re-request (RerequestCheckRun); apps cannot post it. One of `queued`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `rerequested`, `failing`.

`checkRun.conclusion` string

Present iff `status` is `completed` or `rerequested`. For a `rerequested` run it is the superseded attempt's verdict: treat the run as pending and read `conclusion` only when `status == completed`. One of `success`, `failure`, `neutral`, `cancelled`, `skipped`, `timed_out`, `action_required`, `stale`.

`checkRun.createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp.

`checkRun.updatedAt` string

When Origin last wrote the run. Not advanced by a post that was ignored as stale or that repeated the stored values (see `PostCheckRunResponse.outcome`), so it cannot tell those two apart. RFC 3339 timestamp.

`checkRun.externalId` string

Provider-assigned immutable identity for this check attempt (see `CheckRunInput.external_id`: one per execution is the recommended style).

`checkRun.actor` object

Principal that produced the check run; always the owning suite's `actor`.

`checkRun.actor.user` object

`checkRun.actor.user.id` string

`checkRun.actor.user.email` string Required

`checkRun.actor.user.displayName` string

Human-readable display name: the account's first and last name, each trimmed, joined with a space — exactly the name the product UI renders.

`checkRun.actor.user.performedVia.serviceAccount.id` string

`checkRun.actor.user.performedVia.serviceAccount.type` string

Which product or feature the account acts for. Unset when the account no longer exists. The set is append-only: an unrecognized value decodes as unset under `ignoreUnknownFields` / `DiscardUnknown`; treat an unset type as an account of a product you do not recognize, never as an error. One of `bugbot`, `automations`, `agent_serve`, `agent`, `grok_bot`, `env_builds`.

`checkRun.actor.user.performedVia.serviceAccount.displayName` string

Whether the reporting app declared this run re-requestable (`CheckRunInput.is_rerequestable`).

`checkRun.rerequestedAt` string

Set while a re-request is outstanding; cleared when the provider posts again. Unset means no re-request is pending. While set, `status` is `rerequested` and the run stays in the commit's CI state as pending (`conclusion` and the timings are the superseded result); the owning app answers by posting the run it committed to by declaring `is_rerequestable` — a new run for the same `key`, or an update of this run (which clears this field) — after which the run may be re-requested again.

### Check Run Annotations

EVENT

`repository.check_run.annotations.created`

One `CreateCheckRunAnnotations` request appended annotations to a check run (`repository.check_run.annotations.created`). Annotations are append-only (never edited or removed individually), so `.created` is their whole lifecycle, and one request is one event. `check_run` is a reference, not a snapshot: read `GetCheckRun` for the run's status, conclusion, and output. `annotations` is in request order and may be shorter than `annotations_count` when Origin capped the list to keep the body deliverable; page the rest with `ListCheckRunAnnotations`. Like the other check-run webhooks the payload carries no pull request context: resolve the pull request from `sha`.

#### Payload Fields

`repository` object

The repository the check run belongs to.

`repository.id` string

`repository.name` string

`repository.owner` object

The owner of a repo.

`repository.owner.slug` string

Unique URL-friendly name of the owner.

`repository.owner.id` string

Unique ID of the owner namespace.

`repository.owner.type` string

`team` or `user`. Output-only; unset when unknown. One of `team`, `user`.

`checkRun` object

The check run the annotations were appended to, with its suite.

`checkRun.id` string

`checkRun.name` string

`checkRun.checkSuite` object

Suite the check run belongs to.

`checkRun.checkSuite.id` string

`sha` string

Resolved head commit SHA the check run is attached to (lowercase hex).

`baseSha` string

The comparison base the check run was reported against (lowercase hex), when its app supplied one; absent means base-agnostic (see `CheckRun.base_sha`).

`annotations` array

The appended annotations, in request order. May be shorter than annotations\_count when Origin capped the list.

`annotations[].id` string

`annotations[].checkRunId` string

`annotations[].annotationLevel` string

One of `notice`, `warning`, `failure`.

`annotations[].message` string

`annotations[].title` string

`annotations[].rawDetails` string

`annotations[].createdAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp.

`annotations[].updatedAt` string

RFC 3339 timestamp.

`annotations[].location` object

Optional source location for a check-run annotation. `path`, `start_line`, and `end_line` are required whenever the enclosing annotation supplies this message. `path` is canonical and repository-relative, lines and columns are positive 1-based inclusive coordinates, and `columns` is supported only for a single-line range.

`annotations[].location.path` string Required

Maximum UTF-8 size: 4096 bytes.

`annotations[].location.startLine` integer Required

`annotations[].location.endLine` integer Required

`annotations[].location.columns` object

Optional paired columns for a single-line annotation range.

`annotations[].location.columns.startColumn` integer

`annotations[].location.columns.endColumn` integer

`annotationsCount` integer

Number of annotations the request appended.

`createdAt` string

When the batch was appended. RFC 3339 timestamp.

One of `bugbot`, `automations`, `agent_serve`, `agent`, `grok_bot`, `env_builds`.

`installation.installedBy.performedVia.serviceAccount.displayName` string

The product name Cursor shows for the account, such as a Grok bot's name; never empty when present. A Grok bot whose name cannot be read is named "Grok Bot". Omitted when the account has no product name.

`app` object

The app the installation belongs to.

`app.id` string

`app.displayName` string

The app's registered display name, never empty when present. Omitted when enqueue-time hydration could not resolve the app.

**Sample `event.payload`:**

`installation.repositories[].owner` object

The owner of a repo.

`installation.repositories[].owner.slug` string

Unique URL-friendly name of the owner.

`installation.installedBy` object

User who originally installed the app.

`installation.installedBy.id` string

`installation.installedBy.email` string Required

`installation.installedBy.displayName` string

Human-readable display name: the account's first and last name, each trimmed, joined with a space — exactly the name the product UI renders. Omitted when the account has no name; never synthesized from the email, the id, or any other field. May also be absent on webhook payloads whose actor could not be resolved.

`installation.installedBy.handle` string

The user's claimed profile handle (the identity behind cursor.com /@handle), without the @ prefix. Present only while the user's profile is publicly visible; omitted for users without a claimed handle and for non-public profiles.

`installation.installedBy.performedVia` object

Set when an app (with an installation user token) or a service account, such as the user's personal Grok bot, acted on this user's behalf, for the action this field describes: on a comment's author it names what created the comment, not an actor that later edited or deleted it. Absent when the user acted directly; may be absent when delegation data is unavailable.

The app that acted on the user's behalf.

`installation.installedBy.performedVia.app.id` string

`installation.installedBy.performedVia.app.displayName` string

`installation.installedBy.performedVia.serviceAccount.id` string

`installation.installedBy.performedVia.serviceAccount.type` string

Which product or feature the account acts for. Unset when the account no longer exists. The set is append-only: an unrecognized value decodes as unset under `ignoreUnknownFields` / `DiscardUnknown`; treat an unset type as an account of a product you do not recognize, never as an error. One of `bugbot`, `automations`, `agent_serve`, `agent`, `grok_bot`, `env_builds`.

`installation.installedBy.performedVia.serviceAccount.displayName` string

The product name Cursor shows for the account, such as a Grok bot's name; never empty when present. A Grok bot whose name cannot be read is named "Grok Bot". Omitted when the account has no product name.

`app` object

The app the installation belongs to.

`app.id` string

`app.displayName` string

The app's registered display name, never empty when present. Omitted when enqueue-time hydration could not resolve the app.
