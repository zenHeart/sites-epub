### list\_repositories limits

- `pageSize` defaults to 30 and is at most 100.
- Pass the previous response's `nextPageToken` as `pageToken` to read the next page.

### list\_repositories returns

`repositories` (paged), `nextPageToken`

## list\_namespaces

List the Origin namespaces (owner slugs) the caller can list repositories in, ordered by slug. Each slug is a valid owner for list\_repositories; viewerCanCreateRepositories reports whether creating a repository there would be allowed. An empty list means the caller has no Origin repositories to read; repositories on GitHub or other hosts are not reachable through these tools.

- **Access:** Read-only
- **Asks for confirmation:** No
- **On the read-only endpoint:** Yes
- **Required scopes:** `namespace:repositories:read`

### list\_namespaces parameters

| Name        | Type   | Required | Description |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| `pageSize`  | number | No       |             |
| `pageToken` | string | No       |             |

### list\_namespaces limits

- `pageSize` defaults to 30 and is at most 100.
- Pass the previous response's `nextPageToken` as `pageToken` to read the next page.

### list\_namespaces returns

`namespaces` (paged), `nextPageToken`

## create\_repository

Create an empty Origin-hosted repository. Pick an owner from list\_namespaces where viewerCanCreateRepositories is true; omit owner to use the caller's personal namespace, which Origin claims on first use (needs an eligible plan, a Privacy Mode that allows code storage, and no team membership; team members pass their team slug). Both steps are one approval: confirm with the user before calling. defaultBranch defaults to main. Repository names are unique per owner, so retrying after a success fails with a conflict; read the repository with get\_repository instead. Returns the created repository, including cloneUrl.

- **Access:** Writes
- **Asks for confirmation:** Yes
- **On the read-only endpoint:** No
- **Required scopes:** `namespace:repositories:create`

### get\_file\_contents limits

- `content` is truncated after 256 KiB.
- A line range covers at most 500 lines.

### get\_file\_contents returns

`files` (at most 1), `path`, `content`, `encoding`, `sha`, `truncated`, `type`, `entries` (at most 1000), `name`, `size`

## get\_git\_tree

List a git tree in an Origin-hosted repository at a tree SHA, commit SHA, branch, tag, or HEAD: immediate children by default, or the full walk with recursive true. Each entry is path, mode, type (blob, tree, or commit), sha, and size for blobs. Entries past the cap are dropped and truncated is set; list subtrees non-recursively to see more. get\_file\_contents reads one blob.

## grep\_contents

Search file contents across one Origin-hosted repository at a ref, which defaults to the default branch. The query is a regular expression matched case-sensitively; set literal for exact text, or caseInsensitive to ignore case (regex mode prefixes (?i) for GrepContents). wholeWord applies only with literal; for regex use \b. Returns matching lines plus any requested context lines, capped at 1000 matching occurrences, and sets limitHit when that cap is reached. Each returned line contains its full text, so the occurrence cap does not bound response bytes. There is no pagination. Narrow query, filterPath, includes, or excludes to reach other matches.

## list\_commits

List commits from a branch or starting ref in an Origin-hosted repository, optionally filtered by lists of exact git author or committer emails and by inclusive since and until bounds on committer time. A commit matches a list when its email equals any listed email, and must match every list and bound that is given. Email and time filters share one scan of at most 1000 commits per page, so a filtered page can be short or empty while nextPageToken is present. Keep paging to reach older matches. Each item is sha, full message, author, committer, parents, and tree. Omits patches. Continuation calls reuse the filters stored in pageToken.

## list\_pull\_requests

List pull requests in an Origin-hosted repository, filtered by state, head, author, base, or stackId and sorted by creation or update time in either direction. Items are compact summaries (author, timestamps, merged/closedAt/mergedAt, and stack membership when the pull request is stacked); they omit body and diff stats—use pull\_request\_read for those. With stackId, the items are that stack's members in the requested sort order, not stack order; rebuild the tree from each member's stack.parent, and pass state all because the default open state leaves merged members out. Continuation calls must resend those filters with pageToken.

## search\_pull\_requests

Search pull requests across the Origin-hosted repositories the caller can read, written in GitHub's pull request search syntax. A query combines qualifiers (is:open, is:merged, is:draft, author:, review-requested:, reviewed-by:, label:, base:, head:, and created:, updated:, merged: or closed: with a date or range), bare words and quoted phrases matched against text, the operators AND, OR and NOT (or a leading -), parentheses, and one sort: such as sort:updated-desc. repo:owner/name, org: or user: choose the repositories searched; otherwise owner and name choose one, and with neither every repository the caller can read pull requests in is searched. A session limited to specific repositories, such as a cloud agent's, searches only those repositories; if a search is refused for not naming them, name them with repo:owner/name or with owner and name. Results come from a search index and are eventually consistent: a pull request created or changed moments ago can be missing or stale, so read your own writes with list\_pull\_requests or pull\_request\_read. Items are the compact list\_pull\_requests summaries plus each pull request's repository, without stack.parent. totalCount is exact unless totalCountIsLowerBound is set. A query Origin cannot answer fails with every problem and its query\[start:end] span. Continuation calls must resend the same query, owner and name with pageToken. Examples: is:open review-requested:@me, or repo:acme/web is:merged merged:>=2026-09-01.

## pull\_request\_read

Read one Origin-hosted pull request through a single view: summary, files, commits, reviews, comments, or threads. Summary includes labels, requested reviewers, and stack membership (stack id and parent pull request) when the pull request is stacked. The threads view requires threadIds and pages comments in those threads. Comments and threads carry url, a cursor.com link to that thread or comment on the pull request page.

### pull\_request\_read limits

- `pageSize` defaults to 30 and is at most 100.
- Pass the previous response's `nextPageToken` as `pageToken` to read the next page.
- `view` is one of `summary`, `files`, `commits`, `reviews`, `comments`, `stack`, `threads`.
- `threadIds` takes at most 20 items.
- Long `patch` output is returned in chunks.
- A line range covers at most 500 lines.

### pull\_request\_read returns

Set `view` to choose what comes back:

- `summary`: `number`, `title`, `state`, `draft`, `merged`, `author`, `base`, `head`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `closedAt`, `mergedAt`, `body`, `additions`, `deletions`, `changedFiles`, `stack`, `labels` (at most 100), `requestedReviewers` (at most 100)
- `files`: `files` (paged), `path`, `status`, `additions`, `deletions`, `changes`, `patch` (chunked), `truncated`
- `commits`: `commits` (paged)
- `reviews`: `reviews` (paged), `id`, `body`, `verdict`, `author`, `submittedAt`
- `comments`: `comments` (paged), `id`, `body`, `threadId`, `author`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `url`
- `stack` (not yet public): `parent`, `children` (paged), `mergePrefix`, `convergence`
- `threads`: `threads` (paged)

## create\_pull\_request

Create a pull request from an already-pushed branch. To stack it, pass parentPullNumber: the base becomes that pull request's head branch (any other base is rejected), and head must have been built on that branch, meaning the two share a commit beyond the parent's own base. A head built off trunk or from unrelated history is rejected with the rebase to run. A head that has since fallen behind the parent is accepted and the response carries needsRestack, because the pull request cannot land until it is restacked; this tool never restacks. stackParent is the stored parent's number, read back after the create.

## update\_pull\_request

Update a pull request's title, description, and lifecycle through the public fields. Omit title or body to leave that field unchanged; pass an empty body to clear the description. Lifecycle is state (open or closed) plus draft, sent independently: state closed closes and ignores draft; state open reopens, and without draft true marks ready and publishes an existing draft; draft true reopens as a draft, alone or together with state open; draft false marks ready and reopens a closed pull request. Send one lifecycle field, both, or neither, so a metadata-only update is valid. Metadata and lifecycle together send one public UpdatePullRequest. Origin applies present fields in its documented order; a failure can leave some fields applied, so re-read after an error. merged is not writable, and ready is draft false or state open rather than a state value.

## update\_pull\_request\_base

Retarget a pull request's base branch, stack it on another pull request, or move it off its stack. With parentPullNumber, the base becomes that pull request's head branch and the stack parent is set in the same update. With base, the pull request is retargeted to that branch: the head branch of an open pull request makes that pull request the parent, and the default branch or a branch with no open pull request moves it off its stack. Stacking is allowed only when this pull request's branch was built on the parent, meaning the two share a commit beyond the parent's own base; a branch built off trunk or from unrelated history is rejected with the rebase to run. A branch that has fallen behind the parent is accepted and the response carries needsRestack, because the pull request cannot land until it is restacked. This tool stacks and unstacks but never restacks: no commit is rebased or replayed. Returns the stored base and head refs, plus stackParent when stacked.

## merge\_pull\_request

Merge a pull request, or a stack up to and including it. On a stacked pull request this lands every open pull request from the stack root through this one in one commit (one squash commit with squash, one merge commit otherwise); Origin checks every member first and lands nothing if one is blocked. Where a merge queue owns the branch, a single pull request is queued instead, and nothing lands yet. To land a stack one pull request at a time, merge the lowest open one each time; each becomes its own commit, and the ones above usually need a restack after each landing. Requires the expected head SHA of this pull request. Optional mergeMethod (merge or squash); omit it and Origin picks a method the repository accepts. mergedPrefix lists every pull request that landed. Pull requests above the target stay open; skippedDescendants is currently always empty.

### update\_pull\_request\_labels returns

`labels` (at most 100)

## create\_label

Create a repository label so update\_pull\_request\_labels can apply it. label is the name: 1-50 characters, trimmed, and unique in the repository by exact, case-sensitive spelling, so Bug and bug are different labels; reuse an existing label that differs only in case instead of creating another. color is six hex digits with an optional leading #, such as d73a4a; it defaults to ededed. description is optional, at most 255 characters. A name that already exists returns a conflict; apply that label instead.

| `name`  | string | Yes      | Origin repository name within that namespace                                                                                                                                      |

### list\_rulesets returns

`rulesets` (at most 100), `id`, `name`, `kind`, `enforcement`, `includedRefNames` (at most 64), `excludedRefNames` (at most 64), `ruleTypes` (at most 20), `bypassActorCount`, `truncated`

## get\_ruleset

Read one ruleset on an Origin-hosted repository by its id from list\_rulesets: name, description, kind, enforcement, included and excluded ref name patterns, each rule as its ruleType and JSON parameters, and each bypass actor as its kind (user, team, app, or origin\_role), identifiers, and bypassMode.

## get\_repository\_access

Read who can access an Origin-hosted repository. teamAdmins and teamMembers are the team floor. grants has one row per user or group principal with its kind, id, display name (omitted for a user with no name), and policy names: namespacePolicy is the inherited floor, repoPolicy the repository override, and effectivePolicy the broader of the two. A layer with no grant is omitted. Grants past the cap are dropped and truncated is set.
