# Slack

With Cursor's integration for Slack, you can use [Cloud Agents](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent.md) to work on your tasks directly from Slack by mentioning `@cursor` with a prompt.

[Media](/docs-static/images/cloud-agent/slack/slack-agent.mp4)

## Get started

### Installation

1. Go to [Cursor integrations](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard/integrations)

2. Click *Connect* next to Slack or go to [installation page](https://cursor.com/api/install-slack-app) from here

3. You'll be prompted to install the Cursor app for Slack in your workspace.

4. After installing in Slack, you'll be redirected back to Cursor to finalize setup

   1. Connect a repository provider (if not already connected) and pick a default repository
   2. Enable usage-based pricing
   3. Confirm privacy settings

5. Start using Cloud Agents in Slack by mentioning `@cursor`

## How to use

Mention `@cursor` and give your prompt. Cursor tries to detect a repository, model, base branch, or named [cloud agent environment](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/setup.md) from your message. It also uses your recent agent activity when selecting a repository.

For a named environment, include its name in your prompt. For example: `@Cursor use the Platform environment to update the shared API`.

### Commands

Run `@Cursor help` for an up-to-date command list.

#### Syntax formats

Natural:

```bash
@Cursor with opus, fix the login bug in backend-api
```

Inline:

```bash
@Cursor env=Platform branch=dev model=opus autopr=false Fix the login bug
```

Use quotes for environment names with spaces:

```bash
@Cursor env="Platform Services" Update the shared API
```

#### Option precedence

When combining options:

- **Explicit values** override defaults
- **Later values** override earlier ones if duplicated
- **Inline options** take precedence over settings modal defaults
- **`env`** takes precedence over `repo` when both are present

The bot parses options from anywhere in the message, allowing natural command writing.

#### Using thread context

Cloud Agents understand and use context from existing thread discussions. Useful when your team discusses an issue and you want the agent to implement the solution based on that conversation.

Cloud Agents read the entire thread for context when invoked,
understanding and implementing solutions based on the team's discussion.

#### When to use force commands

**When do I need `@Cursor agent`?**

In threads with existing agents, `@Cursor [prompt]` adds follow-up instructions. Who can follow up is controlled by [Team follow-ups](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/settings.md#team-follow-ups). If Team follow-ups is Disabled, only the owner can follow up. To launch a separate agent, use `@Cursor agent [prompt]`, or ask in natural language:

```bash
@Cursor start a new agent to refactor billing
```

Phrases like "create a new agent", "launch a fresh agent", or "new agent please" work the same way.

**When do I need `Add follow-up` (from context menu)?**

Use the context menu (⋯) on an agent's response for followup instructions. Useful when multiple agents exist in a thread and you need to specify which one to follow up on.

### Status updates & handoff

When Cloud Agent runs, you first get an option to *Open in Cursor*.

![Open in Cursor button in Slack](/docs-static/images/cloud-agent/slack/slack-open-in-cursor.png)

When Cloud Agent completes, you get a notification in Slack and an option to view the created PR in GitHub.

![View PR in GitHub in Slack](/docs-static/images/cloud-agent/slack/slack-view-pr.png)

### Managing agents

To see all running agents, run `@Cursor list my agents`.

Manage Cloud Agents using the context menu by clicking the three dots (⋯) on any agent message.

![Slack agent context menu](/docs-static/images/cloud-agent/slack/slack-context-menu.png)

Available options:

- **Add follow-up**: Add instructions to an existing agent
- **Delete**: Stop and archive the Cloud Agent
- **View request ID**: View unique request ID for troubleshooting (include when contacting support)
- **Give feedback**: Provide feedback about agent performance

## Configuration

Manage default settings and privacy options from [Dashboard → Cloud Agents](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard/cloud-agents).

### Settings

#### Default Model

Used when no model is specified in your message. See [settings](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard/cloud-agents) for available options.

#### Repository Selection

Cursor automatically selects the right repository based on:

1. **Your message content** — Repository names or keywords in your prompt
2. **Recent agent activity** — Repositories you've used recently
3. **Routing rules** — Custom keyword-to-repo mappings (see below)
4. **Default repository** — Fallback when no match is found

To use a specific repository, include its name in your message. For example: `@Cursor in mobile-app, fix the login bug`.

#### Base Branch

Starting branch for Cloud Agent. Leave blank to use the repository's default branch (often `main`)

### Channel Settings

Configure default settings at the channel level using `@Cursor settings`. These settings are per team and override your personal defaults for that channel.

Channel settings only apply to public channels.

Particularly useful when:

- Different channels work on different repositories
- Teams want consistent settings across all members

To configure channel settings:

1. Run `@Cursor settings` in the desired channel
2. Set the default repository for that channel
3. All team members using Cloud Agents in that channel use these defaults

Channel settings take precedence over personal defaults but can be overridden
by mentioning a specific repo in your message.

### Routing Rules

Routing rules let you define keywords that automatically map to a target. When your message contains a keyword, Cursor routes the agent to the associated repository or [cloud agent environment](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/setup.md). Environments can bundle multiple repositories, so one keyword can start an agent with every repo it needs already configured.

#### Setting up routing rules

1. Go to [Dashboard → Cloud Agents](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard/cloud-agents)
2. Find the **Routing Rules** section
3. Add keyword-to-target mappings, pointing each keyword at a repository or an environment

#### Example rules

| Keyword    | Target                  |
| :--------- | :---------------------- |
| `frontend` | `acme/web-app`          |
| `mobile`   | `acme/mobile-app`       |
| `api`      | `acme/backend-services` |
| `platform` | `Platform` environment  |

With these rules configured:

- `@Cursor fix the frontend nav bug` → routes to `acme/web-app`
- `@Cursor update the mobile onboarding flow` → routes to `acme/mobile-app`
- `@Cursor add a migration across the platform` → starts in the `Platform` environment, with all its repos ready

Targeting an environment is useful for multi-repo environments. Learn how to
configure one in the [cloud agent docs](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/setup.md), including
[multi-repo environments](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/setup.md#multi-repo-environments).

#### How routing works

Cursor evaluates your message in this order:

1. **Your message content** — Repository names or keywords in your prompt
2. **Recent agent activity** — Repositories you've used recently
3. **Routing rules** — Custom keyword-to-target mappings (repository or environment)
4. **Channel default** — The repository set for this channel
5. **Default repository** — Fallback when no match is found

### Privacy

Cloud Agents support Privacy Mode.

Read more about [Privacy Mode](https://www.cursor.com/privacy-overview) or manage your [privacy settings](https://www.cursor.com/dashboard/cloud-agents).

Privacy Mode (Legacy) is not supported. Cloud Agents require temporary
code storage while running.

#### Display Agent Summary

Display agent summaries and diff images. May contain file paths or code snippets. Can be turned On/Off.

#### Display Agent Summary in External Channels

For Slack Connect with other workspaces or channels with external members like Guests, choose to display agent summaries in external channels.
