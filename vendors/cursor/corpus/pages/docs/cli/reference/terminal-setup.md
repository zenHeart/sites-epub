# Terminal setup

Configure your terminal for the best Cursor CLI experience. This guide covers keybindings for multi-line input, Vim mode, and theme synchronization.

## Quick start

If Shift+Enter doesn't work for newlines in your terminal, run `/setup-terminal` for guidance on configuring alternatives:

```bash
/setup-terminal
```

This command detects your terminal and provides instructions for configuring Option+Enter as an alternative way to insert newlines.

## Universal options

These methods work in **all terminals**, including tmux, screen, and SSH sessions:

| Method | Description                                              |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| +Enter | Type a backslash, then press Enter to insert a newline   |
| Ctrl+J | Standard control character for newline (ASCII line feed) |

If you're in tmux or having trouble with other keybindings, Ctrl+J is the most reliable option.

## Terminal support

### Native Shift+Enter support

These terminals support Shift+Enter for newlines out of the box:

- **iTerm2** (macOS)
- **Ghostty**
- **Kitty**
- **Warp**
- **Zed** (integrated terminal)

### Requires `/setup-terminal`

These terminals need `/setup-terminal` to configure Option+Enter for newlines:

- **Apple Terminal** (macOS)
- **Alacritty**
- **VS Code** (integrated terminal)

### Terminal multiplexers

**tmux** and **screen** intercept Shift+Enter before it reaches applications. Use the universal options instead:

- Ctrl+J — Works reliably in all multiplexer sessions
- +Enter — Also works universally

You can configure your outer terminal (e.g., iTerm2) for Shift+Enter, but the keybinding won't pass through tmux. Use the universal options for the most consistent experience.

## Vim mode

Enable Vim keybindings for navigation and editing in the CLI input area.

### Toggle with slash command

```bash
/vim
```

This toggles Vim mode on or off for the current session and saves the preference.

### Configure in settings

Add to your `~/.cursor/cli-config.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "editor": { "vimMode": true },
  "permissions": { "allow": [], "deny": [] }
}
```

### Modes

Vim mode uses modal editing:

- **Normal mode** — Navigate and execute commands (default when Vim mode is enabled)
- **Insert mode** — Type text normally

Press Esc to return to normal mode from insert mode.

### Navigation

| Key     | Description                                           |
| :------ | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| h, l    | Move left / right                                     |
| j, k    | Move down / up                                        |
| w, b    | Next / previous word                                  |
| e       | End of word                                           |
| W, B, E | Same as above, but for WORD (non-whitespace sequence) |
| 0, $    | Start / end of line                                   |

### Editing

| Key        | Description                                 |
| :--------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| x          | Delete character under cursor               |
| X          | Delete character before cursor              |
| d + motion | Delete range (e.g., `dw` deletes word)      |
| dd         | Delete entire line                          |
| D          | Delete to end of line                       |
| s          | Substitute character (delete + insert mode) |
| S, cc      | Change entire line                          |
| C          | Change to end of line                       |

### Entering insert mode

| Key | Description             |
| :-- | :---------------------- |
| i   | Insert at cursor        |
| a   | Insert after cursor     |
| I   | Insert at start of line |
| A   | Insert at end of line   |
| o   | Open new line below     |
| O   | Open new line above     |

### Counts

Prefix commands with a number to repeat them. For example, `3w` moves forward 3 words, `2dd` deletes 2 lines.

Vim mode affects the input area only. Navigation through chat history and other UI elements uses standard keybindings.

## Terminal theme

Cursor CLI automatically detects your terminal's color scheme and adapts its appearance.

### Automatic detection

The CLI queries your terminal for its background color using standard escape sequences. Most modern terminals support this:

- **Dark terminals** → CLI uses dark theme
- **Light terminals** → CLI uses light theme

### Terminals with automatic detection

These terminals report their color scheme correctly:

- iTerm2
- Ghostty
- Kitty
- Alacritty
- Apple Terminal
- Windows Terminal
- VS Code integrated terminal

### Forcing a theme

If automatic detection doesn't work, you can override it with an environment variable:

```bash
# Force dark theme
export COLORFGBG="15;0"

# Force light theme
export COLORFGBG="0;15"
```

Add this to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) to make it permanent.

### Troubleshooting theme issues

**Colors look wrong:**

- Ensure your terminal supports 256 colors or true color
- Check that `TERM` is set correctly (e.g., `xterm-256color`)
- Try setting `COLORFGBG` explicitly

**tmux users:**

- Add to your `.tmux.conf` to pass through color detection:
  ```
  set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"
  set -ag terminal-overrides ",xterm-256color:RGB"
  ```
- Restart tmux after making changes

## Manual configuration

If `/setup-terminal` doesn't work for your terminal, you can manually configure keybindings.

### Option+Enter for newlines

Option+Enter sends a special escape sequence that Cursor CLI recognizes as a newline. Configure your terminal to send `\x1b\r` (Escape followed by carriage return) when Option+Enter is pressed.

**iTerm2:**

1. Open **Preferences** → **Profiles** → **Keys** → **Key Mappings**
2. Click **+** to add a new mapping
3. Set **Keyboard Shortcut** to Option+Enter
4. Set **Action** to "Send Escape Sequence"
5. Enter `\r` as the escape sequence

**Alacritty:**

Add to your `alacritty.toml`:

```toml
[keyboard]
bindings = [
  { key = "Return", mods = "Alt", chars = "\u001b\r" }
]
```

**Kitty:**

Add to your `kitty.conf`:

```
map alt+enter send_text all \x1b\r
```

### Shift+Enter

Shift+Enter support depends on your terminal correctly reporting the key modifier. Most modern terminals handle this automatically, but some may need configuration.

**VS Code terminal:**

VS Code's integrated terminal may not pass Shift+Enter correctly. Add to your `keybindings.json`:

```json
{
  "key": "shift+enter",
  "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
  "args": { "text": "\u001b[13;2u" },
  "when": "terminalFocus"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

**Keybindings not working:**

- Verify your terminal is detecting the keys correctly using `cat` or `showkey`
- Check if a terminal multiplexer (tmux/screen) is intercepting the keys
- Use Ctrl+J as a reliable fallback

**tmux users:**

- Shift+Enter and Option+Enter won't work through tmux
- Use Ctrl+J or +Enter instead
- These universal options work everywhere, including nested tmux sessions

**SSH sessions:**

- Remote terminal capabilities depend on your local terminal emulator
- Ctrl+J works reliably over SSH
- +Enter is another reliable option

## Summary

| Keybinding   | Works in                          | Notes                                                      |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ctrl+J       | All terminals                     | Most reliable, works everywhere                            |
| +Enter       | All terminals                     | Universal alternative                                      |
| Shift+Enter  | iTerm2, Ghostty, Kitty, Warp, Zed | Native support, no config needed                           |
| Option+Enter | After `/setup-terminal`           | Newline alternative for Apple Terminal, Alacritty, VS Code |
