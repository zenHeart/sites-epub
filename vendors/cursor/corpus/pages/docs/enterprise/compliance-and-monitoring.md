# Compliance and Monitoring

Compliance requires visibility into who did what, when, and why. This documentation covers audit logs, AI code tracking, certifications, and how to meet regulatory requirements.

## Audit logs

Audit logs provide a record of security events and administrative actions. Available on the [Enterprise plan](https://cursor.com/contact-sales?source=docs-audit-logs), audit logs help you meet compliance requirements and investigate security incidents.

We log the following events:

- **Authentication events:** Logins and logouts
- **User management:** User additions (via SSO, invite, signup, team creation, or auto-enrollment), removals, role changes, and individual spend limits
- **API key management:** Team and user API key creation and revocation
- **Team settings:** Team-wide and per-user spending limits, admin settings, team name changes, Slack integration settings, and repository mappings
- **Repository management:** Repository creation, deletion, and settings updates
- **Cloud Agent environments:** Environment creation, updates, restores, and lifecycle changes
- **Directory groups:** Directory group creation, updates, deletion, membership changes, and permission modifications
- **Privacy settings:** Privacy Mode changes at user or team level
- **Team rules:** Team rule management (including Bugbot rules) for custom workflows
- **Team commands:** Custom command creation, updates, and deletion

We do not log agent responses or generated code content.

Instead, we recommend using [hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/hooks.md) to log prompts and code.

### Accessing audit logs

View audit logs in the [team dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/audit-log). This is available on Enterprise plans, and requires admin access.

### Streaming audit logs

For compliance and security monitoring, stream audit logs to your existing systems:

- SIEM systems (Splunk, Sumo Logic, Datadog, etc.)
- Webhook endpoints for custom processing
- S3 buckets for long-term retention
- Log aggregators like Elasticsearch or CloudWatch

Please contact [hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com) if you would like to receive streaming audit logs.

### Log format

Audit logs are delivered as JSON and include metadata and event-specific fields:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2024-10-14T18:30:45Z",
    "event_id": "evt_abc123xyz789"
  },
  "team_id": "team_xyz789",
  "ip_address": "203.0.113.42",
  "user_email": "alice@company.com",
  "event": { /* event-specific fields */ }
}
```

The `event_type` values include:

- `login` - User login events (web or app)

- `remove_user_from_directory_group` - Removing users from directory groups
- `privacy_mode` - Privacy Mode changes (scope: "user" or "team")
- `team_rule` - Team rule management (create, update, delete)
- `team_hook` - Team hooks management (create, update, delete)
- `bugbot_installation` - Bugbot installation events
- `bugbot_installation_settings` - Bugbot installation settings changes
- `bugbot_repo_settings` - Bugbot repository settings changes
- `bugbot_team_rule` - Bugbot-specific rule management (create, update, delete)
- `bugbot_team_settings` - Bugbot team settings changes
- `bugbot_bulk_repo_update` - Bugbot bulk repository update events
- `team_command` - Custom team command management (create, update, delete)

### Searching and filtering

Filter audit logs in the dashboard by:

- Date range
- Event type (authentication, user management, settings)
- Actor (specific user)

Export filtered results to CSV for analysis or compliance reports.

## Usage telemetry over OpenTelemetry

Audit logs cover administrative and security events. If you want usage data instead, such as token, tool call, and cost metrics plus API request and cloud agent logs delivered over OTLP to your own collector, use [OpenTelemetry Export](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/opentelemetry-export.md). It's a separate pipeline from audit-log SIEM streaming and is available on the Enterprise plan.

## Using hooks for compliance logging

Audit logs track administrative actions, but some compliance requirements need logging of development activity. Use hooks to log:

### Prompts submitted hook

```bash
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
prompt=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.prompt')
user_id=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.user_id')

# Log to your compliance system
curl -X POST "https://compliance.company.com/log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"type\":\"prompt\",\"user\":\"$user_id\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}"

cat << EOF
{
  "continue": true
}
EOF
```

### Code generated hook

```bash
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
file_path=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.file_path')
edits=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.edits')

# Log the code generation event (not the actual code)
curl -X POST "https://compliance.company.com/log" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"type\":\"generation\",\"file\":\"$file_path\",\"timestamp\":\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"}"

exit 0
```

**Important:** Be careful logging actual code or prompts. They may contain sensitive information. Log metadata (who, when, what file) rather than content when possible.

See [Hooks](https://cursor.com/docs/hooks.md) for hook implementation details.
