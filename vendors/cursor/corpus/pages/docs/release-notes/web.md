# Cursor web release notes

Weekly changes to Cursor on the web, from integrations and admin settings to automations, the APIs, security and approval agents, and models. Each entry covers one week and is labeled with the Monday that starts it. [Cloud Agents](https://cursor.com/docs/release-notes/cloud-agents.md) and [Bugbot](https://cursor.com/docs/release-notes/bugbot.md) have their own pages.

## Week of Sep 28, 2026

### Integrations

#### GitHub

- **All your GitHub installations and accounts load.** If you have many GitHub App installations, connecting GitHub and picking repositories now shows all of them instead of missing the ones past the first page. If one of several connected GitHub accounts has an expired token, the others still load instead of failing with "GitHub access token is no longer valid".
- **Newly created repositories.** Cursor no longer denies access to a GitHub repository you can write to when GitHub briefly fails to return the repository's details, such as right after it is created.
- **Cloud Agent follow-ups on GitHub Enterprise Server.** Cloud Agents started through a GitHub Enterprise Server app now receive pull request and CI updates for the team that owns the app, instead of having those webhook events rejected.
- **GitHub stays connected through GitHub incidents.** When GitHub briefly rejects valid refresh tokens, Cursor keeps your GitHub connection instead of deleting it, and removes the token only if it keeps failing, so you don't have to reconnect GitHub.

#### GitLab

- **Clearer GitLab access errors.** Starting work on a GitLab project where you lack Maintainer or Owner access now consistently says GitLab Maintainer access is required instead of asking you to reconnect, and the token cooldown error states the remaining wait in minutes or hours.
- **Connecting GitLab clears token cooldowns.** After you connect GitLab, your personal and team repositories are usable right away instead of waiting out a cooldown left by earlier token errors.
- **Organization admins can manage team GitLab and Bitbucket connections.** Organization admins who aren't members of a team can now load and manage that team's GitLab and Bitbucket integrations instead of getting an error.

#### Bitbucket

- **Replies when a comment command can't run.** When @cursor can't run a command from a Bitbucket pull request comment, Cursor now replies on the pull request with the reason, such as needing a linked Bitbucket account or write access, instead of ignoring the comment.

### Dashboard and admin

#### Cloud agents

- **Fix failed Cloud Agent environment builds in one click.** When an environment build fails during install or on its Dockerfile, the environment and build pages show a **Fix Build** button that starts an agent to debug it, including for builds whose snapshot has expired. Builds with a deleted snapshot show a **Snapshot expired** chip and can't be activated, and deactivating the active build warns you when no other build can take over. Builds that fail because your self-hosted source control server is unreachable now say so. See [Cloud Agent Builds](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/builds.md#debug-a-build).

#### Automations

- &#x20;**More control over label triggers in Approver Agents.** A label-change trigger can now fire when a label is added, removed, or either, and you can limit it to one label name. These settings are now saved when you edit the agent.
- &#x20;**Vulnerability Scanner runs in Security Agents run history.** Recent Runs on the Security Agents page now lists Vulnerability Scanner runs next to security reviewer runs.

#### SSO and SCIM

- &#x20;**More reliable SCIM directory sync.** For organizations that own their SCIM directory, groups your identity provider pushes for teams linked to that organization now become synced groups instead of legacy directory groups. In directories with at least 10 users, if your identity provider briefly reports every user with no groups, directory sync no longer removes all directory group memberships.

#### Fixes

- **Fixes to Cloud Agent environment builds.** Build logs open at the newest line and keep following new output until you scroll up. When a page of the builds table comes back empty but older builds exist, it now tells you to use **Next** instead of leaving you stuck, and the **Trigger build** dialog no longer warns that builds are off.
- **Fixes to Cloud Agents settings and runs.** The Run history chart on the Cloud Agents Runs page no longer pushes the page down while it loads. Cloud agent settings refresh while the page is open, and network access entries like `*.example.com` now also match `example.com`.
- &#x20;**Fixes to groups and teams.** On a group's Members tab, the row actions menu stays on screen on wide tables. When you create a team in an organization, the team admin list puts you first and selects you by default.
- **Fixes to the dashboard on mobile.** On mobile, the navigation menu button now sits at the left of the top bar, and long GitHub Enterprise instance names truncate in settings.
- **Fixes to GitLab and Bitbucket integrations.** GitLab and Bitbucket connections on the Integrations page no longer fail to load when the team selected in the dashboard is one you aren't a member of, such as a canceled team. They show as read-only instead.
- **Fixes to Bugbot settings.** Old Bugbot license links open Bugbot settings in Automations.

### Automations

- **GitLab support in pull request triggers and comments.** The Comment on PR action accepts GitLab merge request URLs, including self-hosted GitLab. Git pull request triggers can be saved with a nested GitLab group (group/subgroup) or an organization URL as the org scope, and invalid entries show an error.
- **Clearer run failures.** When a run fails because of a configuration problem, such as a missing branch, an inaccessible repository, a model blocked by your team's region, an API key rate limit, or a missing Slack channel, run history shows the specific reason and what to do. Runs whose agent ran out of memory or whose machine stopped responding say so, and a run that later succeeds shows as succeeded.
- **Fixes to automation runs.** Automations with more than one schedule now run on every schedule instead of only the first. The open pull request step now opens the PR for runs owned by service accounts and for older team automations. Security Reviewer automations triggered by pull request comments or labels run again instead of being skipped, and automations with Slack access no longer stall on each step while re-listing Slack channels.
- **Fixes to team selection and PR Approver.** On cursor.com, automation actions run under the team you have selected instead of your default team. PR Approver reviews no longer say reviewers were assigned when assignment was turned off or failed; they say human review is needed instead.

### APIs

- **Skip the no-issues comment.** [`POST /bugbot/review`](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot.md#trigger-a-review) accepts an optional `postSuccessComment` boolean. Set it to `false` and a review with no new findings doesn't post the "found no new issues" comment. It defaults to `true`.
- **Cost for free Bugbot reviews.** [`GET /analytics/team/bugbot-reviews`](https://cursor.com/docs/bugbot.md#review-analytics) now returns `cost_cents` for seat-based and free-trial reviews, showing their undiscounted model cost, and adds a `billed` field. `billed` is `false` when your team wasn't charged for the review.

### Security and approval agents

- **Admin Only label.** If you can't make changes to Security Agents, its pages now show an Admin Only label next to the page title.
- **Save without linking Slack.** You can now save edits to a security agent without connecting your own Slack account, as long as its Send to Slack channels are unchanged.
- **More reliable security reviews.** Security reviews keep results that finish right at the deadline, retry transient connection errors, and fall back to another model when the selected model is unavailable.

### Models and Cursor Router

- **New model: Claude Sonnet 5.5.** [Claude Sonnet 5.5](https://cursor.com/docs/models/claude-sonnet-5-5.md) is now available in Cursor.
- **New models: GLM 5.3 and GLM 5.3 Flash.** [GLM 5.3](https://cursor.com/docs/models/glm-5-3.md) and [GLM 5.3 Flash](https://cursor.com/docs/models/glm-5-3-flash.md) from Z.ai are now available in Cursor. They're off by default; turn them on in Cursor Settings > Models.

## Week of Sep 21, 2026

### Integrations

#### GitHub

- **Repository access updates right away.** After you connect, reconnect, or disconnect GitHub, changes to which repositories you can access apply immediately instead of after a cache expires.

#### GitLab

- **Renamed and moved projects.** After a GitLab project is renamed or moved, Cursor resolves the current project instead of a stale copy.
- **Disconnecting self-hosted GitLab keeps your GitHub connection.** Disconnecting a self-hosted GitLab instance on the Integrations page now disconnects that instance even when your current team can't see it, instead of disconnecting your GitHub account.

#### Azure DevOps

- **Bugbot repository status.** The Azure DevOps Bugbot dashboard no longer shows enabled repositories as disabled.

### Dashboard and admin

#### Cloud agents

- **Clearer Cloud Agent environment build failures.** Failed environment builds now explain what went wrong, such as "Git provider isn't connected", "No access to a repository", or "GitHub IP allow list blocked access", instead of a generic error. You can activate a draft build while it is still running, and build logs now include an **Ask Agent** link. See [Cloud Agent Builds](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/builds.md#debug-a-build).
- &#x20;**Limit Cloud Agents to selected groups.** Enterprise admins can now set Restrict By to Groups in the Cloud Agents access settings and pick which groups can use Cloud Agents, instead of listing members by name.
- &#x20;**Set spend limits for service accounts.** The service accounts list in the dashboard now shows each account's spend limit and current spend. Admins can edit an account's limit per billing period or set it to No limit.

#### Fixes

- &#x20;**Fixed the team Groups tab.** The Groups tab no longer fails to load with an "invalid int 32" error for some groups.
- &#x20;**Fixed members and invites.** The invite screen now rejects spreadsheets, PDFs, and addresses longer than 255 characters instead of creating broken invites. A newly created invite link now shows up right away instead of appearing missing, and revoking your current session from Active Sessions now signs you out instead of showing an error.
- &#x20;**Model access settings apply more consistently.** Saving a section of the Models page no longer turns a new Cursor model in its 7-day review window on or off by accident. Only an explicit Enable now or Keep disabled choice is saved. Model blocks and release-delay settings for your team now also apply when Auto routes to that model.
- &#x20;**Clearer Network Access Control settings.** The settings now say that the blocklist applies only to the local sandbox, list the patterns each list supports, and warn when an entry, such as an IP address with a port or a path, won't behave as expected in a sandbox list.
- &#x20;**Fixed GitLab for team-owned instances.** On the Integrations page, GitLab repository sync and your personal connection status for a team's GitLab instance now use the team you have selected, so they load and sync correctly.

### Automations

- **Fixes to Slack triggers and channel pickers.** Slack-triggered automations in private channels shared across workspaces now fire for owners who are members of the channel. Slack channel pickers on large workspaces no longer miss channels after a slow load, and Refresh reloads the full channel list.
- **Fixes to automation runs.** Security Reviewer automations triggered by pull request comments or CI completion run again instead of being skipped, and runs whose parent agent is no longer active fail with a clear message instead of retrying.
- **Fixes to the automation editor.** Adding or editing a custom MCP server from an automation's actions no longer drops auth settings such as OAuth scopes.
- **Faster branch picker for Origin repositories.** When you set a branch for an automation trigger on an Origin repository, the default branch now appears right away instead of after the full branch list loads.

### APIs

- **Organization audit logs.** Organization API keys can call [`GET /organizations/audit-logs`](https://cursor.com/docs/account/organizations/organization-admin-api.md#get-audit-logs) to read audit events across the organization. Filter by time range, event type, search text, users, or a single linked team, with pagination.
- **Organization API key expiration.** When you create an Organization API key, you can now set it to expire after 30, 90, or 180 days, or one year. Once a key expires, it no longer authenticates against organization APIs.
- **Look up many commits at once.** The [commit lookup endpoint](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/ai-code-tracking-api.md#get-commit-details) accepts a comma-separated list of up to 100 full commit hashes. Lists with three or more hashes used to return 404; more than 100 now returns 400.

### Security and approval agents

- **Smarter follow-ups on findings.** Partly fixed findings are treated as addressed, and a failed follow-up check leaves the existing thread as is.
- **Overlapping findings stay visible.** A new finding overlapping an acknowledged one is posted as its own comment.
- **Model fallback.** Security reviews fall back to the next model when the preferred model is out of capacity.
- **Every run opens.** Every run in the Security Agents run history is now clickable. A run opens its session transcript, or a run summary when no transcript is available.

### Models and Cursor Router

- **New model: Grok 4.7.** [Grok 4.7](https://cursor.com/docs/models/grok-4-7.md) is now available in Cursor.
- **New model: Claude Opus 5.5.** [Claude Opus 5.5](https://cursor.com/docs/models/claude-opus-5-5.md) is now available in Cursor.
- **Shorter Grok model names.** [Grok 4.5](https://cursor.com/docs/models/grok-4-5.md) and [Grok 4.6](https://cursor.com/docs/models/grok-4-6.md) now appear by those names in the model picker and its tooltips, without the "Cursor" prefix.
- **Auto follows team model settings.** When a team admin blocks a Cursor-served model such as [Grok 4.7](https://cursor.com/docs/models/grok-4-7.md), or the team's release delay for new models hasn't passed yet, Auto no longer routes that team's requests to it.

## Week of Sep 14, 2026

### Integrations

#### Slack

- **Full bot alerts in automations.** Automations triggered from Slack now read the full content of bot alerts that use attachment blocks, instead of only their one-line fallback text.

#### GitLab

- **Large GitLab groups and repositories.** The GitLab repository picker no longer times out on large organizations, and resolving a branch or tag works on repositories with thousands of branches.

#### Azure DevOps

- **Reconnect prompt for expired Azure DevOps access.** When Microsoft Entra rejects your Azure DevOps refresh token, Cursor stops retrying and the dashboard shows the connect card so you can reconnect.
- **Large Azure DevOps access tokens.** The dashboard and Cloud Agent starts no longer fail with a server error when your Azure DevOps access token is larger than 4 KB.
- **Per-organization errors in the Azure DevOps repository picker.** When one Azure DevOps organization refuses to list its projects, the repository picker shows an access error on that organization instead of failing the whole picker.

### Dashboard and admin

#### Members and groups

- &#x20;**Groups pushed from your identity provider now appear as team groups.** When your identity provider pushes a directory group through [SCIM](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim.md#directory-groups), Cursor creates a matching team group in the dashboard and keeps its members in sync. Removing a user from the group in your identity provider removes them from the team group, and deleting the group retires it. Groups that synced before this change keep working as they did.
- &#x20;**Removed members are now signed out everywhere.** When you remove a member from a team that isn't connected to SSO, Cursor ends all of their active sessions so they lose access right away. Sessions stay active only if the member still belongs to another team in the same organization. Your audit log stream also gets a new credentials revoked event that records what happened to the member's sessions, repository access, and cloud agent git tokens.
- **Choose your home team in an organization.** If you're a direct member of two or more teams in your organization that have billing set up, at least one seat, and a subscription that isn't canceled, pick a home team under My Settings > More while a team in that organization is selected in the dashboard. Cursor uses that team for your account when no team is specified, or you can set it to None.
- &#x20;**See a group's Codebase access on a new Access tab.** Team and organization group pages have an Access tab that shows the group's access to your team's Codebase and any repository-specific access, with Manage links to change it.
- &#x20;**Organization admins appear in team member lists.** Team member lists now include admins of the linked organization, labeled Org Admin.

#### Workspace settings

- &#x20;**Turn Projects on or off for your team.** Admins can use the Enable Projects switch in Team Settings, under Chat, to control whether team members can use Projects in Cursor. When it's off, Projects is hidden for everyone on the team.
- &#x20;**Data exports for every team.** The Data Exports tab is no longer limited to Enterprise teams. Any team member with permission to read exports can open it and download archives Cursor has prepared and released for the team, including teams whose subscription has ended. Export links open straight to the right team.
- &#x20;**Admins can run team MCP servers on members' machines.** A new Run team MCP servers on members' machines switch in the Team MCP Servers section of the Plugins & MCPs tab runs every team HTTP MCP server, and each member's own MCP servers, locally in members' IDEs after a confirmation. Cloud agents still run team servers from Cursor's servers. Teams and members can also configure up to 1,000 MCP servers each.
- &#x20;**Connect more than one Jira site to a team.** Admins with a connected Jira site now see a Connect another site action on the Jira page in the dashboard. It opens the Atlassian Marketplace to install Cursor on the new site, and the site list refreshes when you come back.
- **Clearer way back to Agents from settings.** The settings sidebar header now shows a Back to Agents link next to the Cursor mark.

#### Usage and cloud agents

- &#x20;**Security Reviewer spend is easier to track on the Usage page.** Security Reviewer usage is now attributed to Security Reviewer, and you can filter usage events by it. When you filter by Security Reviewer, each review run shows as one row, including the reviewer agents it spawns, instead of being split across many rows.
- **See exactly what a cloud agent environment build used.** Environment [build](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/builds.md) pages now have a Configuration section that shows the build's source, install and start scripts, terminals, and environment.json. Build logs sit in a collapsible Build output panel with an Ask an agent about these logs button, and they keep streaming past one minute without disconnecting or repeating lines.

#### Fixes

- **Dashboard pages no longer jump while they load.** Overview, Usage, Billing, Cloud Agents, and Integrations pages reserve space for banners, usage tables, and invoices, and the dashboard no longer shifts sideways on first load.
- &#x20;**Fixed MCP server and secrets settings.** The Choose Tools dialog stays on screen with its header and Use Selected Tools button visible, scrolls long tool lists, and trims long tool descriptions to three lines with the full text on hover or click. Editing an MCP server no longer drops extra auth settings such as scopes. The update warning for a new secret now appears only when a secret with that name exists in the same scope.
- &#x20;**MCP restrictions on team groups now apply.** MCP settings saved on a team group are now enforced for the group's members. Editing MCP settings on a SCIM directory group linked to a team group saves them to that team group without dropping its existing restrictions.

### Automations

- **Enable Cursor-built agents from a card grid.** The From Cursor section of the Automations page shows each agent as a card with an enabled or disabled badge and an Enable or Manage button.
- **Clearer delete confirmation.** Deleting an automation from the list or its settings page opens a dialog that names the automation and warns that deletion can't be undone, replacing the browser's confirm popup.
- **Fixes for Security Reviewer.** Security Reviewer keeps syncing when a trigger repository is deleted or removed from the GitHub App, covers the repositories in an organization-wide trigger, and retries Origin, GitLab, and Bitbucket repositories that failed to connect.
- **Automations on Origin repositories.** Security Reviewer now triggers on pull requests in team Origin repositories. Origin check runs from automations are grouped under the product name, such as Cursor Automation, and each run is named after its automation.

### APIs

- **Find groups by ID or name.** [Organization group](https://cursor.com/docs/account/organizations/organization-admin-api.md#organization-groups) objects now include a `publicId`, and [List Organization Groups](https://cursor.com/docs/account/organizations/organization-admin-api.md#list-organization-groups) accepts a `name` query parameter that returns the group with that exact name.
- **Filter organization members.** [`GET /organizations/members`](https://cursor.com/docs/account/organizations/organization-admin-api.md#list-organization-members) now accepts `email`, `userId`, `search`, `organizationRole`, and `teamId` query filters. `email` and `userId` each take up to 100 comma-separated values.
- **Team directory groups.** The [Admin API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api.md#team-directory-groups) adds `/teams/directory-groups` endpoints to list, create, read, update, and delete a team's directory groups, including each group's name and monthly spending limit, and to add or remove members by user ID.

### Security and approval agents

- **MCP actions after a review.** When a review finishes, Security Reviewer carries out the actions your custom instructions ask for, using the agent's configured MCP servers.
- **Redesigned run transcripts.** Opening a Security Reviewer run that ran on Cursor-managed hosting shows a transcript styled like Cloud Agents.

### Models and Cursor Router

- **1M context kept on Cloud Agent follow-ups.** A Cloud Agent started on the 1M-context variant of [GPT-5.6 Terra](https://cursor.com/docs/models/gpt-5-6-terra.md) now shows 1M in the web follow-up model picker, and follow-ups run at 1M instead of 272K.

## Week of Sep 7, 2026

### Integrations

#### GitHub

- **Accurate GitHub connect errors.** If connecting GitHub fails, the callback page now says whether you were rate limited, hit an authorization problem, or are missing an installation, and shows an error code and request ID instead of a generic rate-limit message.
- **Clear error past the repository limit.** When a request needs access to more repositories than GitHub allows in one installation token, Cursor now explains the limit instead of asking you to reinstall the GitHub App.
- **Team marketplaces refresh from private repositories.** Plugin marketplace refresh can now authenticate through a GitHub App installation owned by another team in the same organization, so marketplaces on child teams pick up updates from private repositories.

#### GitLab

- **Connect self-hosted GitLab to the right team.** Connecting a self-hosted GitLab instance from the Integrations page now links the selected team, and its repositories populate there, instead of your default team.
- **Reliable host removal.** Deleting a GitLab host now removes all of its repositories, even when webhook cleanup fails for some of them.

#### Bitbucket

- **Complete Bitbucket Cloud pull request lists.** Listing closed or all Bitbucket Cloud pull requests now includes merged, declined, and superseded ones.
- **Faster Data Center registration errors.** Registering a Bitbucket Data Center instance now fails within seconds when the host is unreachable instead of hanging through retries.
- **Bitbucket Cloud pull request diffs.** Pull request diffs from Bitbucket Cloud now load when Bitbucket redirects the request.

### Dashboard and admin

#### Admin

- &#x20;**Download team data exports from the dashboard.** Enterprise admins now have a Data exports tab that lists the exports prepared for their team, with a download link for each archive. The tab stays available after a subscription ends, so you can still retrieve your team's data. Available on Enterprise plans.
- &#x20;**Confirm before turning off Security Agents or Approval Agents.** Turning off Security Agents or Approval Agents in team settings now opens a confirmation dialog, where you can optionally share why you're turning it off.
- &#x20;**Build the MCP allowlist from your configured servers.** In team MCP Configuration, the MCP Allowlist's Add Rule menu lets you enter a custom rule or pick one of your team's configured MCP servers, each marked Allowed by default, Already allowed, or Blocked by allowlist. For a URL MCP server, Choose Tools lists the server's tools, after you sign in if needed, so you can pick the tools the policy allows instead of typing their names.
- &#x20;**Confirm decisions on new Cursor models.** On the Models page, choosing Enable now or Keep disabled (previously Block) for a new Cursor model in its 7-day review window now asks you to confirm. Pending rows show the date the model will be enabled automatically and no longer carry a New model label.

#### Analytics

- &#x20;**Redesigned team Analytics charts.** The Active Users chart on the [Analytics page](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/analytics.md) now stacks CLI, Cloud Agents, and Bugbot activity with an All line. Every chart shares one color palette with a clickable legend below it. Hover a chart to download its data or copy the matching API curl command.

#### Members

- &#x20;**Team Admin and Org Admin are now labeled separately.** Member lists, role pickers, CSV exports, and the organization member detail page now show team admins as Team Admin and organization admins as Org Admin.
- &#x20;**Members > Set Cap now warns when a higher limit still applies.** If you set a member's spend cap below a higher group or team limit, the dashboard tells you to lower that limit instead. Before, the save went through with no message and the member's limit stayed the same.

#### SSO and SCIM

- &#x20;**SCIM keeps team-owned groups and organization access in sync with your identity provider.** When a directory group maps to a group owned by a team, [SCIM](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim.md) now adds its members to that team, including existing members who were missing from it.

#### Fixes

- **Fixed several issues in the Automations editor.** User MCP servers are now dimmed in the tool picker, with a tooltip, when an automation runs as a service account. The model picker no longer shows raw model IDs while models load, and the remove button on MCP server rows is always visible.
- &#x20;**Fixed SCIM group mappings that changed the wrong memberships.** Mappings no longer add users to extra teams or refill the root team when a directory group already maps elsewhere, and no longer remove members still covered by another mapped group. Full syncs now defer removals when directory data is incomplete.
- **Fixed issues with cloud agent environments.** Members who can't create team environments can no longer save a new environment with Team scope. When an environment build fails because the repository's GitHub App belongs to another team, the builds page now shows a warning saying so.

### Automations

- **Auto tier now saves in automations.** Choosing Cost, Balance, or Intelligence for Auto in an automation's model picker now saves correctly, and cloud runs launch with the tier you picked. Before, every tier reopened and ran as Balance.
- **Model pickers no longer flash raw model IDs.** The model pickers in the automation prompt editor wait for the model list to load instead of briefly showing internal model IDs.
- **Fixes to automation saves.** Saving an automation on a self-hosted GitLab repository whose host uses a host-level service account no longer fails while setting up webhooks.

### Security and approval agents

- **GitLab and Bitbucket reviews.** Security Reviewer now reviews GitLab merge requests and Bitbucket pull requests, posting a summary comment and a status check on the change.
- **More runs in run history.** The Security Agents run history now includes Security Reviewer runs that ran on Cursor-managed hosting. Click one to open its session view.
- **Confirm before turning off.** Turning off Security Agents or PR Routing & Approval for your team now asks you to confirm, and you can optionally say why.

### Models and Cursor Router

- **New model: Muse Spark 1.3.** [Muse Spark 1.3](https://cursor.com/docs/models/muse-spark-1-3.md) from Meta is now available in Cursor.
- **Cursor Grok 4.6 sees images directly.** [Cursor Grok 4.6](https://cursor.com/docs/models/grok-4-6.md) now receives images you attach and images returned by tools as images, instead of working from text descriptions of them.

## Week of Aug 31, 2026

### Integrations

#### GitHub

- **Clearer error for suspended GitHub App installations.** When the Cursor GitHub App installation is suspended, Cursor now says so and points you to the app status in your GitHub organization settings.
- **Stale Bugbot comments are cleared.** When Bugbot clears reviews from a previous run on a GitHub pull request, their bodies are replaced with a short "Stale Bugbot comment from a previous run." note. Comments from anyone else are left alone.
- **Correct GitHub Enterprise installation.** When installation IDs from different GitHub Enterprise Server instances collide, Cursor now picks the installation of the GitHub Enterprise app your team or account owns.

#### Azure DevOps

- **Bugbot works with spaces in names.** Bugbot no longer fails silently on Azure DevOps repositories whose organization, project, or repository name contains spaces.

### Dashboard and admin

#### Cloud agents

- &#x20;**Manage Self-hosted Machines pools from the Cloud Agents dashboard.** Team Pools is now called Self-hosted Machines. The All Self-hosted Machines page lists each pool with its repository, active and idle machines, total machines, and a Sessions column. Admins can set a pool's Reconnect Window or delete a pool without taking its connected machines offline. See [Self-hosted pools](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/self-hosted/pool.md).
- &#x20;**See Cloud Agent activity at a glance, with full run history on a new Runs page.** The Cloud Agents page now opens with Total runs, Success rate, and Recent runs cards for the date range you pick. Select All Runs to open the Runs page, with a run history chart, a runs table, and filters for trigger, status, and creator. Team admins see runs across the team, and personal users see their own.

#### Members, groups, and SSO

- &#x20;**Remove members from your organization.** Organization admins can now choose Remove from Organization from a member's row menu on the organization Members page. After you confirm, the person loses access to every team in the organization and can move to an individual Cursor plan. You can't remove yourself this way.
- &#x20;**Copy settings from an existing team when you create an organization team.** A new step when you create a team in an organization lets you pick a source team and choose which settings to copy: models, security, rules and commands, hooks, MCP and plugin policy, spending limits, and team access defaults. A preview shows what each category will copy and lists connections, such as the GitHub App or MCP servers, that you'll need to set up again.
- &#x20;**Directory groups move into groups without losing spend limits.** SCIM directory groups that have moved into [organization groups](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/organization-groups.md) no longer appear twice on the Groups page or in directory settings, and ones not yet moved show a Legacy badge. Filtering analytics or members by a moved directory group includes its new group's members. Members with a lower individual spend limit keep it instead of getting the group's higher limit.
- &#x20;**Sort group members by usage and spending limit.** On the Members tab of a group synced from your identity provider, click the Username, usage, On-Demand Spend, or Limit column header to sort, and click again to reverse the order. When you sort by limit, members with no limit appear last.
- &#x20;**Warning before SCIM sync removes team members.** When you switch a team or group to Synced, or change which directory groups it syncs from, the dashboard now asks you to confirm before saving. The warning explains that members outside the selected groups are removed, and that switching back to Manual doesn't restore them. Read more about [SCIM provisioning](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/scim.md).

#### Analytics

- &#x20;**Refreshed Analytics charts.** Charts on the Analytics page and the dashboard overview share one color palette, a more compact layout, and a two-column tile grid on mobile and tablet. The AI commits chart labels the editor series Desktop and replaces Primary Branch Only with a Primary Branch checkbox. See [team analytics](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/analytics.md).

#### Settings and navigation

- &#x20;**More models in admin model settings, and simpler Fable data-retention consent.** Newer models now appear in admin model settings, so admins can enable, disable, or restrict them, and Muse Spark models appear under Meta on the Models page. Teams that accepted the data-retention consent for Claude Fable 5 don't need to accept it again for Fable 5.1. In organization and group settings, the exemption section is now called "Anthropic: Claude Fable Data Retention Exemption" and links to Organization Groups for organizations that include contractors or other third parties.
- &#x20;**Clearer Origin switch in team settings.** The Origin section of team settings now has an Enable Origin switch: on means your team can create Origin repositories. It replaces the old "Disable creating Origin repositories" switch, and your current setting is unchanged. The description explains that turning Origin off makes existing repositories read-only and hides the Codebase tab.
- **Shared organization links open your own organization.** Links to cursor.com/organization now open the same page in your organization's dashboard, keeping the rest of the path and any query string. If your account isn't part of an organization, you see a not-found page.
- **Easier navigation on mobile and clearer page titles.** On a phone, tap a dashboard page title to jump to another section from a dropdown, and open your account from the avatar in the header. The Overview, Analytics, and Usage pages now show a title at the top.

#### Fixes

- &#x20;**Fixed SCIM group sync.** Members provisioned through SCIM are now added to organization groups and passed on to mapped teams instead of being skipped, and synced groups no longer get stuck in an errored state. Adding a group-to-team mapping no longer removes existing team members. Creating a group with a duplicate name, or deleting a group that still has SCIM mappings, now explains what went wrong.
- &#x20;**Fixed the Integrations page for multi-team organizations.** Disconnecting GitLab now disconnects the team you have selected, and GitHub Enterprise, GitLab Self-Hosted, and Bitbucket Data Center rows load installations for that team. Self-hosted GitLab connections no longer fail when another team in the organization already registered the same host. Long instance names now end with an ellipsis, and integration rows lay out correctly on mobile.
- &#x20;**Cloud Agent secrets no longer show another team's secrets.** When you switch teams, the secrets list now shows the selected team's secrets, and creating, editing, and deleting secrets applies to that team instead of your default team.
- **Cloud Agents settings pages keep their header while you scroll.** Environment detail pages, Repository Routing, Team Secrets, and My Secrets now have a sticky breadcrumb header in place of the old back links. The Environments list has a compact Repo filter, and Edit is now the primary action on an environment's page.
- **Fixed tooltip and diff glitches in settings and admin pages.** The Billable Seats tooltip on the Members page now opens below its label instead of hiding behind the header, and Audit Log value diffs no longer show stray "No newline at end of file" markers. The API Keys and Protected Git Scopes sections also have more consistent layouts.

### Automations

- **Search remote machines when picking an environment.** The Remote Machines menu in an automation's environment picker is now searchable by machine name, path, repo, or pool, and groups your own machines under My Machines. Pools show how many workers are active and whether they are busy.
- **Approval Agents only offer supported repositories.** When you set up an Approval Agent, the trigger menu and the org and repository pickers only offer repositories Approval Agents support, so you can no longer pick a GitLab or Bitbucket repository. If an unsupported repository is still selected, saving shows an error asking you to remove it.
- **Fixes to automation launches and runs.** Automations on GitLab repos no longer fail to launch when a repo needs re-linking, and automations owned by removed team members are reliably disabled.
- **Teammates can manage team automations.** Deleting a team automation now works from the team you have selected instead of failing access checks, and teammates other than the creator can save Slack channels on managed review agents such as Security Reviewer.

### APIs

- **Manage organization groups from the API.** The [Organization API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/organizations/organization-admin-api.md#organization-groups) can now create, rename, and delete groups, and set or clear a group's monthly spending limit. Group responses include `memberCount` and `monthlySpendingLimitDollars`.
- **Model access covers every configurable model.** The [model access](https://cursor.com/docs/account/organizations/organization-admin-api.md#model-access) routes now list and accept every model you can configure, including hidden models and all of their parameters. Models that are unavailable, end-of-life, or internal no longer appear and are rejected.
- **Set spend limits in bulk.** The [Admin API](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/admin-api.md#set-user-spend-limits-in-bulk-preview) adds `POST /teams/user-spend-limits`, in preview, to set or clear spend limits for up to 100 team members in one request. The response reports each member as `updated`, `unchanged`, or `failed`.

### Security and approval agents

- **Search your security agents.** The Security Agents list has a search box that filters agents by name.

### Models and Cursor Router

- **New model: Claude Fable 5.1.** [Claude Fable 5.1](https://cursor.com/docs/models/claude-fable-5-1.md) is now available in Cursor. With Privacy Mode on, or on an Enterprise plan, Anthropic's data retention terms must be accepted before it can be used.
- **New model: Gemini 3.8 Flash.** [Gemini 3.8 Flash](https://cursor.com/docs/models/gemini-3-8-flash.md) is now available in Cursor.
- **Fast mode in Max Mode for GPT-5.6.** You can now turn on Fast for [GPT-5.6 Sol](https://cursor.com/docs/models/gpt-5-6-sol.md), [GPT-5.6 Terra](https://cursor.com/docs/models/gpt-5-6-terra.md), and [GPT-5.6 Luna](https://cursor.com/docs/models/gpt-5-6-luna.md) in Max Mode. Previously, turning on Fast switched these models out of Max Mode's long context.
