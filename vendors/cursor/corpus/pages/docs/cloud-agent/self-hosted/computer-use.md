# Computer use and desktop sharing

Computer use lets an agent on a [Self-Hosted Machines](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/self-hosted.md) worker click, type, take screenshots, and drive applications with a UI. Agents can also drive a browser when the worker has Chrome or Chromium installed. It works on macOS and Linux workers, for both [My Machines](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/self-hosted/my-machines.md) and [Team Pools](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/self-hosted/pool.md). Desktop sharing lets authorized viewers watch or take control of a Linux agent desktop from Cursor. For the product behavior on managed Cloud Agents, see [Capabilities](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/capabilities.md).

Computer use and desktop sharing are new. Install or update to the latest
Cursor CLI before you follow this guide: run `agent update`, or reinstall
with the steps in [Install the CLI](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/self-hosted/pool.md#install-the-cli).

Both features are explicit opt-ins and are never enabled by the server.
Computer use runs on macOS and Linux workers. Desktop sharing
(`--share-desktop`) is Linux-only.

## Enable computer use

Start the worker with `--computer-use`. Worker flags go before `start`:

```bash
agent worker --computer-use start
```

Pool workers take the same flag:

```bash
agent worker --pool gpu --computer-use start
```

What happens next depends on the operating system. On macOS, the worker drives the signed-in desktop session through a helper app called **Cursor Computer Use**, and you grant it two macOS privacy permissions. On Linux, the worker uses an X11 display and needs desktop packages installed first.

## macOS

On macOS, computer use runs through **Cursor Computer Use**, a small helper app the CLI manages for you. It clicks, types, and captures the screen of the desktop session the worker runs in. The Cursor desktop app is not required on the worker.

- **Installed by the CLI.** The first `agent worker --computer-use start` on a Mac downloads Cursor Computer Use from `downloads.cursor.com` and installs it as `~/.cursor/cursor-computer-use/Cursor Computer Use.app` when it is missing.
- **One app identity.** Bundle identifier `co.anysphere.cursor-computer-use`, signed with Apple Team ID `DCNK4UB866`. This is a different app from **Cursor Agent Helper** (`co.anysphere.cursor.agent-helper`), which `--share-desktop` uses.
- **Needs a signed-in desktop.** The worker uses the login GUI session of the macOS user that runs it. `--display` and virtual displays are Linux only.
- **Needs two permissions.** macOS requires **Accessibility** (to move the mouse and type) and **Screen Recording** (to take screenshots) for Cursor Computer Use. The worker doesn't check or request these for you. Until you grant them, the agent's clicks and screenshots fail.

### Install Cursor Computer Use

### Start the worker with computer use

Sign in to the Mac as the user that will run the worker, then start it:

```bash
agent worker --computer-use --name "build-mac-01" start
```

For a pool worker, add `--pool`:

```bash
agent worker --pool --computer-use start
```

The first start installs Cursor Computer Use if it is missing, then macOS prompts for permissions.

### Grant Accessibility and Screen Recording to Cursor Computer Use

Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**. Under **Accessibility**, turn on **Cursor Computer Use**. Under **Screen & System Audio Recording** (called **Screen Recording** on older macOS versions), turn on **Cursor Computer Use**.

Grant the permissions to **Cursor Computer Use**, not to Terminal, your shell, or the Cursor app. Permissions you already granted to those apps don't carry over. If macOS asks you to quit and reopen the app after granting Screen Recording, stop and restart the worker.

### Verify the install and the permissions

```bash
agent worker debug
```

The report confirms Cursor Computer Use is installed. It doesn't report permission state, so test that too: start the worker and send a task from [cursor.com/agents](https://cursor.com/agents) that asks the agent to open a browser, visit a page, and take a screenshot. The screenshot shows up in the chat when both permissions are in place.

macOS 15 (Sequoia) and later periodically ask the logged-in user to
re-confirm Screen Recording for apps that capture the screen directly. If
screenshots stop working on a long-running worker, look for a pending
"Allow For One Month" prompt in the GUI session and approve it, then run
`agent worker debug` again.

### Grant permissions the right way

Both permissions are granted to a specific app by the signed-in user. A few rules keep the setup working across restarts, updates, and fleets:

- **Grant to Cursor Computer Use.** macOS keys each permission to the app's bundle identifier (`co.anysphere.cursor-computer-use`) and code signing requirement. Granting Accessibility or Screen Recording to Terminal, iTerm, `agent`, Cursor, or Cursor Agent Helper does nothing for computer use.
- **Grant as the worker's user.** Sign in as the macOS account that runs the worker before you grant permissions or take a snapshot. Screen Recording approvals belong to that user account.
- **Keep a desktop session alive.** The worker needs a signed-in GUI session. On machines that reboot unattended, turn on automatic login for the worker's user and keep the display awake in **System Settings → Lock Screen** and **Energy**.
- **Let the CLI manage the app.** Install and update Cursor Computer Use only through `agent worker --computer-use start`. Don't copy, re-sign, or rebuild the app; a changed signing identity makes macOS treat it as a new app and your grants stop applying.
- **Re-test after changes.** After a macOS upgrade or a CLI update that replaces Cursor Computer Use, run a screenshot task again.

Don't script around the prompts. Editing the macOS privacy database or
disabling System Integrity Protection breaks the protections your Mac relies
on and isn't supported. Use System Settings or an MDM profile instead.

### Use an app bundle you deploy

If your MDM or imaging process already places Cursor Computer Use on the machine, point the worker at that bundle instead of letting the CLI download one. Set `CUA_SERVICE_APP` in the environment of the `agent worker` process (for example, in the launchd plist that starts it) to the path of the `.app` bundle. The worker uses that bundle and skips the download.

Grants follow the app's code-signing identity and install location. If you point `CUA_SERVICE_APP` at a bundle in a different location, or swap in a build signed with a different identity, macOS treats it as a new app and asks for Accessibility and Screen Recording again.

### Manage permissions with MDM

If your Macs are enrolled in an MDM, build a Privacy Preferences Policy Control (PPPC) profile for Cursor Computer Use. Cursor doesn't ship a `.mobileconfig` today. Apple limits what a profile can do for each permission:

| Permission       | Profile support                                                                                                                   | What to do                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accessibility    | A profile can allow it silently on most macOS versions. Apple deprecates silent allow for Accessibility starting with macOS 26.2. | Set `Allowed` for `co.anysphere.cursor-computer-use` under the `Accessibility` service. On macOS 26.2 and later, plan for a user to approve it in System Settings.                                  |
| Screen Recording | A profile can't allow it. Apple requires a person to approve it in System Settings.                                               | Set `AllowStandardUserToSetSystemService` for `co.anysphere.cursor-computer-use` under the `ScreenCapture` service so a standard (non-admin) user can approve it without an administrator password. |

Each payload entry needs the bundle identifier, the Team ID (`DCNK4UB866`), and the code requirement. Read the code requirement from the app the CLI installed so it matches the build you ship:

```bash
codesign -d -r - ~/.cursor/cursor-computer-use/Cursor\ Computer\ Use.app
```

Because Screen Recording always needs a human approval, plan for one approval per image rather than one per machine. See the next section.

### Prepare a fleet: grant once, then image

Permissions persist on the machine, so grant them once on a template Mac, prove they work, and snapshot it. Every worker restored from that image comes up with computer use ready, as long as the app, its path, and the logged-in user stay the same. The pattern is grant, verify, snapshot.

### Prepare the template

Sign in as the worker's user. Install the CLI and sign in or set the pool API key. Enable automatic login for this user so the desktop session exists after a reboot.

### Install and grant

Run `agent worker --computer-use start` once so the CLI installs Cursor Computer Use. Grant Accessibility and Screen Recording to Cursor Computer Use, or push your PPPC profile and approve Screen Recording. Stop the worker.

### Verify

```bash
agent worker debug
```

Confirm the report shows Cursor Computer Use installed. Then start the worker and run a task that takes a screenshot and clicks something in an app. Continue only when the screenshot comes back and the click lands; `agent worker debug` alone doesn't prove the permissions are granted.

### Snapshot

Take the VM snapshot or disk image from this state. Restore it for each worker and start the worker with `--computer-use` under `launchd` or your process manager.

Re-grant and re-snapshot when:

- A CLI update replaces Cursor Computer Use with a build whose signing identity changed. Screenshots and clicks fail until you grant again.
- The worker runs as a different macOS user than the one that granted the permissions.
- You upgrade the template to a new macOS major version. Run the screenshot test again and grant again if it fails.

## Linux

On Linux, computer use uses an X11 display. The worker reuses a display you already run, or creates its own.

### Install dependencies

On each Linux worker, install the desktop packages. Cursor does not install system packages for you:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
  dbus-x11 ffmpeg tigervnc-standalone-server \
  x11-utils x11-xserver-utils xdotool xfce4
```

`xdotool`, `ffmpeg`, and the X11 utilities are always required. `tigervnc-standalone-server` and `xfce4` are needed when the worker creates a desktop itself: the managed display for computer use on headless machines, and the isolated desktop for desktop sharing.

Install Chrome or Chromium (optional, recommended) for browser computer use.

For [pools](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/self-hosted/pool.md), bake the packages into your worker image so every machine comes up ready.

### Choose the X11 display

The worker resolves the display for computer use in this order:

1. **`--display <display>`.** Require an existing X11 display, for example `:0`. If the display isn't reachable, worker start fails instead of falling back.
2. **Inherited `DISPLAY`.** Without `--display`, the worker reuses a reachable `DISPLAY` from its environment. If it isn't reachable, the worker falls back to a managed desktop.
3. **Managed desktop.** With no display configured, the worker starts its own TigerVNC desktop running an Xfce session. This is the default on headless machines and needs the `tigervnc-standalone-server` and `xfce4` packages.

```bash
# Reuse a desktop you already run
agent worker --computer-use --display :0 start

# Let the worker create a managed desktop (headless machines)
agent worker --computer-use start
```

### Share the agent desktop

Desktop sharing is separate from computer use and is Linux-only. To let authorized viewers watch or control the agent desktop from Cursor, add `--share-desktop`:

```bash
agent worker --computer-use --share-desktop start
```

`--share-desktop` takes an optional mode: `view` (watch only) or `view_and_control` (viewers can take mouse and keyboard control, the default). Sharing uses a worker-created, isolated agent desktop, not the machine's own session, and requires `tigervnc-standalone-server`. A fail-closed input filter on the machine enforces control, and clipboard transfer stays blocked.

Pixels leave the machine only through the worker's existing outbound connection. No inbound ports open.

## Verify the setup

Run the preflight report:

```bash
agent worker debug
```

On macOS, the report shows whether Cursor Computer Use is installed. It doesn't check Accessibility or Screen Recording, so verify those with a real task: ask the agent to take a screenshot and click something. On Linux, the report checks each required binary, whether the configured display is reachable, and whether the worker can fall back to a managed desktop.

### Why do screenshots or clicks fail on my Mac worker?

Run `agent worker debug` to confirm **Cursor Computer Use** is installed.
If the install failed, check that the worker can reach
`downloads.cursor.com`. If it is installed, the permissions are missing:
grant Accessibility and Screen Recording to **Cursor Computer Use** in
System Settings → Privacy & Security, restart the worker, and run the
task again. The worker doesn't check these permissions for you.

### I granted the permissions to Terminal or Cursor Agent Helper. Why doesn't it work?

macOS attaches Accessibility and Screen Recording to a specific app. The
worker drives the desktop through Cursor Computer Use
(`co.anysphere.cursor-computer-use`), so that app needs the permissions,
not the terminal that launched `agent`, the Cursor app, or Cursor Agent
Helper (`co.anysphere.cursor.agent-helper`), which only handles
`--share-desktop`.

### Can I grant Screen Recording from my MDM without a user clicking anything?

No. Apple doesn't let a profile allow Screen Recording. A profile can set
`AllowStandardUserToSetSystemService` so a standard user can approve it
without an administrator, and you can approve once on a template Mac and
[snapshot it](https://cursor.com/docs/cloud-agent/self-hosted/computer-use.md#prepare-a-fleet-grant-once-then-image).

### Does the worker need the Cursor desktop app on macOS?

No. The CLI installs Cursor Computer Use on its own. Workers commonly run
on Macs with no Cursor app installed.
