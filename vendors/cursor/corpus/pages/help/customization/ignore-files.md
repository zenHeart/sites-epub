# Ignore files

Control which files Cursor includes in AI context by using ignore files.

## How do I exclude files from Cursor?

Create a `.cursorignore` file in your project root. Add patterns for files and folders you want excluded:

```text
node_modules/
dist/
*.min.js
.env*
```

Cursor already ignores `.env` files, `.git/`, and lock files by default. See the [full default ignore list](https://cursor.com/docs/reference/ignore-file.md) for details.

Ignored files are blocked from Agent. Terminal commands and MCP tools run outside of Cursor's file access controls, so they may still be able to read ignored files.

## Does Cursor respect .gitignore?

Yes. Cursor automatically respects your `.gitignore` patterns. Files ignored by git are also excluded from AI context.

`.cursorignore` is for additional exclusions beyond what `.gitignore` covers.

## Why should I ignore files?

- **Large generated files** are rarely useful as context
- **Secrets and credentials** are safer excluded from AI context
- **Binary files and assets** add noise without value
- **Third-party code** (like `node_modules`) is rarely useful as context
