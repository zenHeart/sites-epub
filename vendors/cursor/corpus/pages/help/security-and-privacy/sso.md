# SSO and authentication

SSO with SAML 2.0 is available at no additional cost on Teams and Enterprise plans. Where you configure it depends on whether you use team-level or org-level SSO.

## What do I need before setting up SSO?

- A Cursor Teams or Enterprise plan
- Admin access to your identity provider (e.g., Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace)
- Admin access to your Cursor team (Teams) or organization (Enterprise)

## Where do I configure SSO?

- **Teams:** Open [Single Sign-On (SSO) settings](https://cursor.com/dashboard/team-settings#single-sign-on-sso) in Team Settings.
- **Enterprise:** Open the Organization's Settings. Org-level SSO is configured there, not in Team Settings. See [Organizations](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/organizations.md#identity-model).

Team-level SSO stays available for a team that needs its own identity provider. Most Enterprise orgs should use org-level SSO.

## How do I set up SSO?

For team-level SSO, follow the [SSO setup reference](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso.md). You'll need admin access to both your identity provider and your Cursor team.

For org-level SSO on Enterprise, set up the connection in the Organization's Settings. See [Organizations](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/organizations.md#identity-model) and [Identity and access management](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/identity-and-access-management.md#single-sign-on-sso-and-saml).

## Does Cursor support SCIM provisioning?

Yes, on Enterprise plans with SSO enabled. SCIM automatically manages team members through your identity provider, keeping your Cursor team in sync with your organization.

## How do I view my SSO configuration and domains?

For team-level SSO, team admins can review the connection status and its domain in [Single Sign-On (SSO) settings](https://cursor.com/dashboard/team-settings#single-sign-on-sso). Click "Configure" next to "SSO-Provider Connection Settings" to view the provider connection details. Click "Configure" next to "Domain Verification Settings" to view or manage verified domains.

For org-level SSO, org admins review the connection in the Organization's Settings. See [Organizations](https://cursor.com/docs/enterprise/organizations.md#identity-model).

## Why do I see AADSTS50105 or "User is not assigned to this application"?

Your identity provider blocked the sign-in. The Cursor enterprise app requires assignment, and you are not assigned to it. Cursor cannot add you.

Ask your IT admin to assign you to the Cursor app as a user, or as a direct member of an assigned group. Nested groups often fail on Microsoft Entra ID and similar providers. Being in a group nested under an assigned group is not enough.

After they assign you, wait a few minutes for the change to propagate, then sign in again.

See [SSO troubleshooting](https://cursor.com/docs/account/teams/sso.md#user-is-not-assigned-to-this-application) for the admin version of these steps.
