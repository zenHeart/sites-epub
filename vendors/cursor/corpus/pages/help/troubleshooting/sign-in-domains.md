# Which domains does Cursor sign-in need?

Cursor sign-in is moving to accounts.spacex.ai and accounts.x.ai (replacing authenticator.cursor.sh as the sign-in page). Your Cursor app, site, and SSO tiles keep working, and nobody gets logged out.

If your company uses a firewall or proxy allowlist (for example Zscaler), add the domains below. If accounts.spacex.ai or accounts.x.ai are blocked on your network, sign-in falls back to the old page for now, so nobody is locked out.

We recommend adding the domains as soon as you can so your users get the new sign-in page from day one. The fallback is temporary. Once it is retired on October 30, sign-in requires accounts.spacex.ai and accounts.x.ai.

If your team has bookmarks or internal docs that point to authenticator.cursor.sh, update them to accounts.spacex.ai and accounts.x.ai.

## Prefer wildcards

Use wildcards when you can, so you do not have to update the list later:

- `*.spacex.ai` (covers accounts.spacex.ai and related auth hosts)
- `*.x.ai` (covers accounts.x.ai, auth.x.ai, and related auth hosts)
- `*.grok.com` (covers auth.grok.com and grok.com)
- `*.grokusercontent.com` (covers auth.grokusercontent.com; serves user-generated Grok content)
- `*.grokipedia.com` (covers auth.grokipedia.com; Grokipedia shares Grok accounts)

## Minimum hosts

If your policy will not allow wildcards, allow at least:

- `accounts.x.ai`
- `accounts.spacex.ai`
- `auth.x.ai`
- `auth.grok.com`
- `auth.grokusercontent.com`
- `auth.grokipedia.com`

## Still required for Cursor itself

These are unchanged:

- `.cursor.sh` (includes authenticator.cursor.sh)
- `.cursor-cdn.com`
- `.cursorapi.com`
- `.cursorvm.com` and `.*.cursorvm.com`

## Notes for IT / admins

- Existing Cursor sessions stay signed in. This is not a forced logout
- SSO IdP config (Okta tiles, ACS URLs, and similar) does not need to change for this change
- Cursor app, website, and API hosts (cursor.com, api\*.cursor.com) are not changing

If login fails and your network uses an allowlist, have IT add the domains above, then retry from accounts.spacex.ai or accounts.x.ai, or your existing IDP / authenticator.cursor.sh.
